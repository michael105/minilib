	If splitvt fails to run and prints out the message:
"Can't initialize screen: Your terminal lacks the XX termcap capability."
then do "make clean", remove "-DTERMCAP" from the CFLAGS line in the
Makefile and then recompile.

	Under AT&T System V.3.2 (a 3b2 machine) I had to add the line:
CC = gcc
at the top of the Makefile so that it didn't get a syntax error in
/usr/include/sys/wait.h.  This particular 3b2 machine had been souped
up with gcc and other exotic software. 

	Under Sun/OS 5.0 (Solaris 2.1), running gcc, the grantpt()
function breaks under the -O compiling option.  Just remove that 
from the CFLAGS, and everything will work fine.
