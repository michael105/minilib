Announcing the newest version of splitvt!

SECURITY ALERT!!!

	splitvt versions lower than 1.6.5 are known to have a
security hole allowing a user to gain ROOT access on some systems!

	If you have a version lower than 1.6.5 _please_ remove
the set-uid bit on your current version, and upgrade to the newer
version as soon as possible.
("splitvt -version" will tell you what version you are running)

The set-uid bit is only for updating the utmp database and for
changing ownership of its pseudo-terminals.  It is not necessary
for splitvt's operation.

The latest version is available via the web at:
	http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/projects/splitvt/


What it is:

	Splitvt is a program that splits any vt100 compatible 
screen into two - an upper and lower window in which you can run
two programs at the same time.  Splitvt differs from screen in 
that while screen gives you multiple virtual screens, splitvt splits
your screen into two fully visible windows.  You can even use 
splitvt with screen to provide multiple split screens.  This can 
be very handy when running over a modem, or for developing
client-server applications or watching routine tasks as you work.

	If you are using splitvt in a new and unusual way,
I'd like to hear about it!

Will it run on my system?

	Well, if you run a UNIX that has pseudo-tty support, 
chances are that splitvt will work on your system.  Splitvt has
been ported to all of the "standard" unices, and also to a few
oddball unices, such as AIX, NewsOS, MP-RAS, and NeXT.

Well, that about wraps it up.  I hope you enjoy this software,
originally conceived by Dave Ljung and created by yours truly.


Enjoy!
