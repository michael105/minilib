	Well, this program just splits your screen into two 
windows, each running a shell, so you can do two things at once.
All you have to do is unbundle the package and run the 'Configure' 
script that is included.  It is fairly simple, and should run on
any terminal that supports hardware scrolling regions.  At the 
moment, only vt100 compatible terminals (such as xterm, decterm,
linux console, etc) will run splitvt.

	More documentation for this program can be found in the
file "splitvt.man".

	If you have trouble compiling or running splitvt, remember
that you must run it within a vt100 compatible terminal, and check
the "NOTES" file in this distribution for hints.

Enjoy!

The idea for this program came from Dave Ljung (dxl@hpesdxl.fc.hp.com)
