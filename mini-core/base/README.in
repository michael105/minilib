### Static builds for linux amd64

Compiled abd linked with the standard toolchain, gcc and ld,  -Os;

I'm trying to get a usable basic Unix system (without kernel) built statically within 64kB,
it's going to be interesting.

(Admittedly, possibly it's going to be 128kB. But not more.)

The commands here all shall dump there usage on invocation with -h, showing the implemented arguments.
(Coding this now)

Just now I'm thinking about adding a tool "help" - which could be invoked by the other tools,
also to dump the usage. 

Some sources in this directory are originally written by ammongit (github.com/ammongit/minutils) 
and modified by me.

I also reused some fragments of minix.
I kept all copyright notices within the sources.
