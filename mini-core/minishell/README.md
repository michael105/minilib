This looks like a study project of ivan ignatiev.

I'm quite sure, I scraped it from github.

It's an absolut minimal shell - no globbing, no script constructs
(no loops, conditionals, andsoon)

I keep it here, just cause of its minimal size.

5.8kB, compiled statically with minilib.

compile with "make"
