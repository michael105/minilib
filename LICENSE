I did this minilib out of enthuiasm.
One side, I`d like to have this project being opensource.
On the other hand, I spent really much time with the development.
In an ideal world, someone would sponsor me for this time.
It is, however, not an ideal world we are living in.
Therefore I do have to insist on attributions and what
I`d like to call `fair use`.

In short, you are allowed to do with this project what you wish,
as long you show the copyright notice at a prominent place, 
and include the file NOTICE in distributions.

That`s the intention of this license,
which I`d like to name "Fair use with attribution".
