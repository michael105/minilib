beta release v.XXX of minilib.

The script minimake contains the bundled minilib with ldscripts.

syntaxcheck.h is a headerfile with all definitions of minilib,
intended to be used by syntaxcheck plugins.

Documentation is available at https://github.com/michael105/minilib

Currently I've tested only with gcc 9.3 and clang 11,
clang throws some bugs yet with several functions and combinations
of optimization flags, they are documented in the section "Bugs"
of the readme at the github repository. 

Patches welcome.
