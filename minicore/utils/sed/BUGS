So far no regression over the historic sed are known. If you find a bug,
please provide a test-case (.sed, .in and .out, look into tests/) - if
possible try to debug the problem and propose a patch.

We will focus on POSIX conformance and small size - GNU sed extensions are
most likely not accepted.
