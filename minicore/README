Ongoing work.

I'm trying to get a usable unix system (without the kernel)
within 64kB. All tools statically linked.

Ok. Possibly it will be 128kB.

We'll see. 

For now I keep this here, within minilib,
since porting the tools is sort of a testcase for the minilib.
(Memo to me:) basic unix core tools could be a great testcase:
 compile them, and then let them execute a test script.
 the needed scripts are already inpkemented in test/

As soon as the base core tools are ported,
I'm going to create a separate repo.
