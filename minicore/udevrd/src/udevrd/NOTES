concept scripted config 

Advantages:
 
 syntaxcheck of the names
 parsing doesn't need to be done within the program to configure.
 -> no convesions, etc.
 A simple mmap (or read) is enough.
 possibility to compress (or encrypt) the data transparent.
 signed config files.

 Within the program, the variables can be accessed by name.
 (compile time)
 efficient. Also for the strings.
 Further datatypes: list, array(?)

 check config would be good. (just load the config
 and check the begin and end tokens.
 -> between the sections should be a token for safety.

	sections:

	 either begin and end
	 or:
	 
[ sectionname ]


[ section2 ]


endfile

(
	[/ is also possible
)

[ name ] -> syntaxcheck also possible. ( $2 needs to be ']' )



extract config:



	write config
	parse config, generate shell script to parse the config
	 -> the shell script communicates with writeconf via tokens.
	   ( write type (long,int,p_rel,..) - write value )
			predefined tokens (e.g. bitfield, dir|file| .. : 
			defined as " e.g. values log STDOUT 1 STDOUT 2 KERNEL 4 .."
			conf log STDOUT|KERNEL

			-> type explicit.

	-> parse config file to generate c header.
	 use sed. simple. (?)
	 just use perl.
	 values need to be in order. ?
	 eventually. not.
	 
	typedef struct config{
		int var1;
		int var2l
		p_rel str1;
		p_rel str2;
		char stringsstart[0];
	}

(include comments)?


begin config

# first var
int var1 12

# 2. var
int var2 42

string str1 "example1"

# empty string
string str2 

values logtarget STDOUT 1 STDERR 2 KERNEL 4 FILE 8

int logtarget STDOUT STDERR


end config

begin_list devices

 int var1
 int var2
 string str1
 string str2

end_list devices


-> creates p_next pointer. (poss. p_prev as well)


  func set_value(){
		eval "$1"=$2
	}
	
	func int_logtarget(){
		for i in $*
			


function f2(){ p="$1"; echo "${!p}"; }

-> 
v=23
f2 v -> 23

needs bash.
