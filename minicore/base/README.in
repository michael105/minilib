### Static builds for linux amd64

Compiled and linked with the standard toolchain, gcc and ld,  -Os;

I'm trying to get a usable basic Unix system (without kernel) built statically within 64kB,
it's going to be interesting.

(Admittedly, possibly it's going to be 128kB. But not more.)

The commands here all shall dump there usage on invocation with -h, showing the implemented arguments.
(Coding this now)

Just now I'm thinking about adding a tool "help" - which could be invoked by the other tools,
also to dump the usage. 



These tools are from other authors and modified by me:

David Bell: dd 

grep,mkdir (xv6)

ammongit: uname,cat,basename

minutils: tee,tail

Andy Tannenbaum (minix): head



All other tools are written by me and BSD Licensed.
