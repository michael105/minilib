Please do notice,
the compat headers are more or less 'unstable' and mostly untested.

They aim at being able to compile source files without changing them.

However, it might be more safe to use the minilib via a specific configuration.
The configuation is described within the "reference", configuration.

Most possibly I'm going to strip the compat headers.
It is just too much work, having more than three possibilities to use the minilib.
At least, as long the whole library is under development.
