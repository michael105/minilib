malloc


AGAIN BLOAtinG.
This drives me nuts.
hello and hello-combined suddenly > 185B.
WTF
used to be around 150B.
  Seriously, it's a problem - 
	I simply don't know what's happening just now.
	So I cant be sure, e.g., every single function
	suddenly has an overhead of 30B.
	Which wouldn't be that great.



Sort the buildsystem out.
Two or three unified ways.
	
	include "minilib.c"
	  or
	include "minilib.h"
	  or
	(?)



ansic headers



------ Useful:


compat headers -> just change the CFLAGS / LDFLAGS to use minilib



contrib
	compile some useful tools together


include tcc (?)

busybox(?)


------ Platforms:




OSX x32 
   Might be useful to port. Not sure.
   
LINUX x32
   'Backport' ... 
   
ANDROID
   I myself need the port.
   
AVR, PIC, ..

BSD

===== Done =====


syscallstubs as header.

testing framework
  check each function and document the result.



 LINUX x64
   Port. Although I'm not sure, whether that's useful
	 Done. Some bugs seem to be left
 

OSX x64
 test different optimization flags. 
   Flag -Os doesnt produce runnable code.
 check syscall ABI. (param 4 - %ecx or %r10 ??? )
