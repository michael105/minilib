===== TODO =====


Sort the buildsystem out.
Two or three unified ways.
	
	include "minilib.c"
	  or
	include "minilib.h"
	  or
	(?)


syscallstubs as header.



------ Useful:


compat headers -> just change the CFLAGS / LDFLAGS to use minilib



contrib
	compile some useful tools together


include tcc (?)

busybox(?)


------ Platforms:




OSX x32 
   Might be useful to port. Not sure.
   
LINUX x32
   'Backport' ... 
   
ANDROID
   I myself need the port.
   
AVR, PIC, ..
 


===== Done =====

 LINUX x64
   Port. Although I'm not sure, whether that's useful
	 Done. Some bugs seem to be left
 
testing framework
  check each function and document the result.


OSX x64
 test different optimization flags. 
   Flag -Os doesnt produce runnable code.
 check syscall ABI. (param 4 - %ecx or %r10 ??? )
