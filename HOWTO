# Howto .. in short


If you'd like to try this minilib,
there are two ways:

1. (The faster one)

  download minilibcombined.c

  download hello-combined.c
  ( source attached below, with explanations..)

  compile:

	gcc -o hello-combined hello-combined.c -static -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -nostartfiles -Wl,-n,-s,--gc-sections,-nostdlib,-Tldscripts/ld.script.onlytext 



2. Or clone the git.. 

(I recommend. If something's broken, 
 it might be nearly impossible to find 
 within the huge combined files)


git clone https://github.com/michael105/minilib.git minilib

copy minilib/makefile.template ./makefile

  (edit makefile. set "PROG" to your program's name)

copy minilib/minilib.h ./
  
	(edit minilib.h uncomment functions, you need)


copy minilib/minilib.c ./

  ( That's the source file of minilib,
	  which will include the other sources,
		in order to build minilib.o to be linked with your program.
		Only functions, you define to be build in minilib.h
		will be included)

add the line below to you source(s)
#include "minilib.h"

make




=======================================
file:    hello-combined.c
=======================================

  // build start, the entry point for the OS
#define mini_start

  // define and build the function "write"
#define mini_write

 // build on OSX ( atm I can't check whether 32bit linux works )
#define OSX

 // build with 64bit
#define X64

 // include definitions as well as the sources.
 // Only functions, you define before, will be built.
#include "minilibcombined.c"

int main(){
		write(stdout, "Hello world!\n", 13);
		return(0);
}
