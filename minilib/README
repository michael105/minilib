Essentially the files minilib_header.h and minilib_implementation.c
in this directory pull in all needed sources for compiling,
dependent on which functions have been marked via 
#define mini_printf (for example)


They are included from minilib.h / minilib.c in the topmost directory.


The other (good) option of including the headers/sources is 
to include the headerfiles located in minilib/compat.
