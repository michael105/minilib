Many header files within the "headers" directory 
(in the linux kernel source tree, as well as with musl)
are just links (includes). Often only a link to another link.
And when you have to look up something,
you'll need to open every single include in the editor -
just to open the editor again, now with the linked include.
Thats tedious.

So I'm going to put links to the real includes into this directory. 
In order to be sort of compatible, we are going to need this.
(some do a include "linux/sys(header.h", other include "asm/header.h", 
the next include "asm-generic/header.h"...)
