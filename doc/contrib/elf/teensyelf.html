If you're a programmer who's become fed up with software bloat, then
may you find herein the perfect antidote.
</p>
<p>
This document explores methods for squeezing excess bytes out of
simple programs. (Of course, the more practical purpose of this
document is to describe a few of the inner workings of the ELF file
format and the Linux operating system. But hopefully you can also
learn something about how to make really teensy ELF executables in the
process.)
</p>
<p>
Please note that the information and examples given here are, for the
most part, specific to ELF executables on a Linux platform running
under an Intel-386 architecture. I imagine that a good bit of the
information is applicable to other ELF-based Unices, but my
experiences with such are too limited for me to say with certainty.
</p>
<p>
Please also note that if you aren't a little bit familiar with
assembly code, you may find parts of this document sort of hard to
follow. (The assembly code that appears in this document is written
using Nasm; see <a href="http://www.nasm.us/">http://www.nasm.us/</a>.)
</p>
<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p>
In order to start, we need a program. Almost any program will do, but
the simpler the program the better, since we're more interested in how
small we can make the executable than what the program does.
</p>
<p>
Let's take an incredibly simple program, one that does nothing but
return a number back to the operating system. Why not? After all, Unix
already comes with no less than two such programs: true and
false. Since 0 and 1 are already taken, we'll use the number 42.
</p>
<p>
So, here is our first version:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  /* tiny.c */
  int main(void) { return 42; }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
which we can compile and test like so:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall tiny.c</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
</pre>
</p>
<p>
So. How big is it? Well, on my machine, I get:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
     3998 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
(Yours will probably differ some.) Admittedly, that's pretty small by
today's standards, but it's almost certainly bigger than it needs to
be.
</p>
<p>
The obvious first step is to strip the executable:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s tiny.c</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
     2632 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
That's certainly an improvement. For the next step, how about
optimizing?
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s -O3 tiny.c</b>
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
     2616 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
That also helped, but only just. Which makes sense: there's hardly
anything there to optimize.
</p>
<p>
It seems unlikely that there's much else we can do to shrink a
one-statement C program. We're going to have to leave C behind, and
use assembler instead. Hopefully, this will cut out all the extra
overhead that C programs automatically incur.
</p>
<p>
So, on to our second version. All we need to do is return 42 from
main(). In assembly language, this means that the function should set
the accumulator, eax, to 42, and then return:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  ; tiny.asm
  BITS 32
  GLOBAL main
  SECTION .text
  main:
                mov     eax, 42
                ret
</pre>
</p>
<p>
We can then build and test like so:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f elf tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s tiny.o</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
</pre>
</p>
<p>
(Hey, who says assembly code is difficult?) And now how big is it?
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
     2604 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Looks like we shaved off a measly twelve bytes. So much for all the
extra overhead that C automatically incurs, eh?
</p>
<p>
Well, the problem is that we are still incurring a lot of overhead by
using the main() interface. The linker is still adding an interface to
the OS for us, and it is that interface that actually calls main(). So
how do we get around that if we don't need it?
</p>
<p>
The actual entry point that the linker uses by default is the symbol
with the name <def>_start</def>. When we link with gcc, it automatically
includes a _start routine, one that sets up argc and argv, among other
things, and then calls main().
</p>
<p>
So, let's see if we can bypass this, and define our own _start
routine:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  ; tiny.asm
  BITS 32
  GLOBAL _start
  SECTION .text
  _start:
                mov     eax, 42
                ret
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Will gcc do what we want?
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f elf tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s tiny.o</b>
  tiny.o(.text+0x0): multiple definition of `_start'
  /usr/lib/crt1.o(.text+0x0): first defined here
  /usr/lib/crt1.o(.text+0x36): undefined reference to `main'
</pre>
</p>
<p>
No. Well, actually, yes it will, but first we need to learn how to ask
for what we want.
</p>
<p>
It so happens that gcc recognizes an option called <def>-nostartfiles</def>.
From the gcc info pages:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
-nostartfiles
<br/>
          Do not use the standard system startup files when
          linking. The standard libraries are used normally.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Aha! Now let's see what we can do:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f elf tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s -nostartfiles tiny.o</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  Segmentation fault
  139
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Well, gcc didn't complain, but the program doesn't work. What went
wrong?
</p>
<p>
What went wrong is that we treated _start as if it were a C function,
and tried to return from it. In reality, it's not a function at all.
It's just a symbol in the object file which the linker uses to locate
the program's entry point. When our program is invoked, it's invoked
directly. If we were to look, we would see that the value on the top
of the stack was the number 1, which is certainly very
un-address-like. In fact, what is on the stack is our program's argc
value. After this comes the elements of the argv array, including the
terminating NULL element, followed by the elements of envp. And that's
all. There is no return address on the stack.
</p>
<p>
So, how does _start ever exit? Well, it calls the exit() function!
That's what it's there for, after all.
</p>
<p>
Actually, I lied. What it really does is call the _exit() function.
(Notice the leading underscore.) exit() is required to finish up some
tasks on behalf of the process, but those tasks will never have been
started, because we're bypassing the library's startup code. So we
need to bypass the library's shutdown code as well, and go directly to
the operating system's shutdown processing.
</p>
<p>
So, let's try this again. We're going to call _exit(), which is a
function that takes a single integer argument. So all we need to do is
push the number onto the stack and call the function. (We also need to
declare _exit() as external.) Here's our assembly:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  ; tiny.asm
  BITS 32
  EXTERN _exit
  GLOBAL _start
  SECTION .text
  _start:
                push    dword 42
                call    _exit
</pre>
</p>
<p>
And we build and test as before:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f elf tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s -nostartfiles tiny.o</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Success at last! And now how big is it?
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
     1340 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Almost half the size! Not bad. Not bad at all. Hmmm ... so what other
interesting obscure options does gcc have?
</p>
<p>
Well, this one, appearing immediately after -nostartfiles in the
documentation, is certainly eye-catching:
</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
-nostdlib
<br/>
         Don't use the standard system libraries and startup
         files when linking. Only the files you specify will
         be passed to the linker.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
That's gotta be worth investigating:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s -nostdlib tiny.o</b>
  tiny.o(.text+0x6): undefined reference to `_exit'
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Oops. That's right ... _exit() is, after all, a library function.
It has to be filled in from somewhere.
</p>
<p>
Okay. But surely, we don't need libc's help just to end a program,
do we?
</p>
<p>
No, we don't. If we're willing to leave behind all pretenses of
portability, we can make our program exit without having to link with
anything else. First, though, we need to know how to make a <def>system
call</def> under Linux.
</p>
<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p>
Linux, like most operating systems, provides basic necessities to the
programs it hosts via system calls. This includes things like opening
a file, reading and writing to file handles &mdash; and, of course,
shutting down a process.
</p>
<p>
The Linux system call interface is a single instruction: <def>int 0x80</def>.
All system calls are done via this interrupt. To make a system call,
eax should contain a number that indicates which system call is being
invoked, and other registers are used to hold the arguments, if any.
If the system call takes one argument, it will be in ebx; a system
call with two arguments will use ebx and ecx. Likewise, edx, esi, and
edi are used if a third, fourth, or fifth argument is required,
respectively. Upon return from a system call, eax will contain the
return value. If an error occurs, eax will contain a negative value,
with the absolute value indicating the error.
</p>
<p>
The numbers for the different system calls are listed in
/usr/include/asm/unistd.h. A quick peek will tell us that the exit
system call is assigned the number 1. Like the C function, it takes
one argument, the value to return to the parent process, and so this
will go into ebx.
</p>
<p>
We now know all we need to know to create the next version of our
program, one that won't need assistance from any external functions to
work:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  ; tiny.asm
  BITS 32
  GLOBAL _start
  SECTION .text
  _start:
                mov     eax, 1
                mov     ebx, 42  
                int     0x80
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Here we go:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f elf tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>gcc -Wall -s -nostdlib tiny.o</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Ta-da! And the size?
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
      372 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now <em>that's</em> tiny! Almost a fourth the size of the previous version!
</p>
<p>
So ... can we do anything else to make it even smaller?
</p>
<p>
How about using shorter instructions?
</p>
<p>
If we generate a list file for the assembly code, we'll find the
following:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  00000000 B801000000        mov        eax, 1
  00000005 BB2A000000        mov        ebx, 42
  0000000A CD80              int        0x80
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Well, gee, we don't need to initialize all of ebx, since the operating
system is only going to use the lowest byte. Setting bl alone will be
sufficient, and will take two bytes instead of five.
</p>
<p>
We can also set eax to one by xor'ing it to zero and then using a
one-byte increment instruction; this will save two more bytes.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  00000000 31C0              xor        eax, eax
  00000002 40                inc        eax
  00000003 B32A              mov        bl, 42
  00000005 CD80              int        0x80
</pre>
</p>
<p>
I think it's pretty safe to say that we're not going to make this
program any smaller than that.
</p>
<p>
As an aside, we might as well stop using gcc to link our executable,
seeing as we're not using any of its added functionality, and just
call the linker, ld, ourselves:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f elf tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>ld -s tiny.o</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
      368 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Four bytes smaller. (Hey! Didn't we shave five bytes off? Well, we
did, but alignment considerations within the ELF file caused it to
require an extra byte of padding.)
</p>
<p>
So ... have we reached the end? Is this as small as we can go?
</p>
<p>
Well, hm. Our program is now seven bytes long. Do ELF files really
require 361 bytes of overhead? What's in this file, anyway?
</p>
<p>
We can peek into the contents of the file using objdump:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>objdump -x a.out | less</b>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The output may look like gibberish, but right now let's just focus on
the list of sections:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  Sections:
  Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
    0 .text         00000007  08048080  08048080  00000080  2**4
                    CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
    1 .comment      0000001c  00000000  00000000  00000087  2**0
                    CONTENTS, READONLY
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The complete .text section is listed as being seven bytes long, just
as we specified. So it seems safe to conclude that we now have
complete control of the machine-language content of our program.
</p>
<p>
But then there's this other section named ".comment". Who ordered
<em>that</em>? And it's 28 bytes long, even! We may not be sure what this
.comment section is, but it seems a good bet that it isn't a necessary
feature....
</p>
<p>
The .comment section is listed as being located at file offset
00000087 (hexadecimal). If we use a hexdump program to look at that
area of the file, we will see:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  00000080: 31C0 40B3 2ACD 8000 5468 6520 4E65 7477  1.@.*...The Netw
  00000090: 6964 6520 4173 7365 6D62 6C65 7220 302E  ide Assembler 0.
  000000A0: 3938 0000 2E73 796D 7461 6200 2E73 7472  98...symtab..str
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Well, well, well. Who'd've thought that Nasm would undermine our quest
like this? Maybe we should switch to using gas, AT&amp;T syntax
notwithstanding....
</p>
<p>
Alas, if we do:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  ; tiny.s
  .globl _start
  .text
  _start:
                xorl    %eax, %eax
                incl    %eax
                movb    $42, %bl
                int     $0x80
</pre>
</p>
<p>
... we will find:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>gcc -s -nostdlib tiny.s</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
      368 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
... no difference!
</p>
<p>
Well, actually there is some difference. Turning once again to
objdump, we see:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  Sections:
  Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
    0 .text         00000007  08048074  08048074  00000074  2**2
                    CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
    1 .data         00000000  0804907c  0804907c  0000007c  2**2
                    CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
    2 .bss          00000000  0804907c  0804907c  0000007c  2**2
                    ALLOC
</pre>
</p>
<p>
No comment section, but now we have two useless sections for storing
our nonexistent data. And even though these sections are zero bytes
long, they incur overhead, bringing our file size up for no good
reason.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so just what is all this overhead, and how do we get rid of it?
</p>
<p>
Well, to answer these questions, we must begin diving into some real
wizardry. We need to understand the ELF format.
</p>
<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p>
The canonical document describing the ELF format for Intel-386
architectures can be found at
<a href="http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf">http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf</a>. (You can also find a
flat-text version of version 1.0 of the standard at
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/ELF.txt">http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/ELF.txt</a>.) This
specification covers a lot of territory, so if you'd prefer to not
read the whole thing yourself, I'll understand. Basically, here's what
we need to know:
</p>
<p>
Every ELF file begins with a structure called the <def>ELF header</def>. This
structure is 52 bytes long, and contains several pieces of information
that describe the contents of the file. For example, the first sixteen
bytes contain an "identifier", which includes the file's magic-number
signature (7F 45 4C 46), and some one-byte flags indicating that the
contents are 32-bit or 64-bit, little-endian or big-endian, etc. Other
fields in the ELF header contain information such as: the target
architecture; whether the ELF file is an executable, an object file,
or a shared-object library; the program's starting address; and the
locations within the file of the <def>program header table</def> and the
<def>section header table</def>.
</p>
<p>
These two tables can appear anywhere in the file, but typically the
former appears immediately following the ELF header, and the latter
appears at or near the end of the file. The two tables serve similar
purposes, in that they identify the component parts of the file.
However, the section header table focuses more on identifying where
the various parts of the program are within the file, while the
program header table describes where and how these parts are to be
loaded into memory. In brief, the section header table is for use by
the compiler and linker, while the program header table is for use by
the program loader. The program header table is optional for object
files, and in practice is never present. Likewise, the section header
table is optional for executables &mdash; but is almost <em>always</em> present!
</p>
<p>
So, this is the answer to our first question. A fair piece of the
overhead in our program is a completely unnecessary section header
table, and maybe some equally useless sections that don't contribute
to our program's memory image.
</p>
<p>
So, we turn to our second question: how do we go about getting rid of
all that?
</p>
<p>
Alas, we're on our own here. None of the standard tools will deign to
make an executable without a section header table of some kind. If we
want such a thing, we'll have to do it ourselves.
</p>
<p>
This doesn't quite mean that we have to pull out a binary editor and
code the hexadecimal values by hand, though. Good old Nasm has a flat
binary output format, which will serve us well. All we need now is the
image of an empty ELF executable, which we can fill in with our
program. Our program, and nothing else.
</p>
<p>
We can look at the ELF specification, and /usr/include/linux/elf.h,
and executables created by the standard tools, to figure out what our
empty ELF executable should look like. But, if you're the impatient
type, you can just use the one I've supplied here:
</p>

This image contains an ELF header, identifying the file as an
Intel 386 executable, with no section header table and a program
header table containing one entry. Said entry instructs the program
loader to load the entire file into memory (it's normal behavior for a
program to include its ELF header and program header table in its
memory image) starting at memory address 0x08048000 (which is the
default address for executables to load), and to begin executing the
code at _start, which appears immediately after the program header
table. No .data segment, no .bss segment, no commentary &mdash; nothing but
the bare necessities.
</p>
<p>
So, let's add in our little program:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  ; tiny.asm
                org     0x08048000
  
  ;
  ; (as above)
  ;
</p>
<p>
  _start:
                mov     bl, 42
                xor     eax, eax
                inc     eax
                int     0x80
  
  filesize      equ     $ - $$
</pre>
</p>
<p>
and try it out:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f bin -o a.out tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>chmod +x a.out</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
</pre>
</p>
<p>
We have just created an executable completely from scratch. How about
that? And now, take a look at its size:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
       91 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<em>Ninety-one</em> <em>bytes</em>. Less than one-fourth the size of our previous
attempt, and less than one-<em>fortieth</em> the size of our first!
</p>
<p>
What's more, this time we can account for every last byte. We know
exactly what's in the executable, and why it needs to be there. This
is, finally, the limit. We can't get any smaller than this.
</p>
<p>
Or can we?
</p>
<p>

<p>
Well, if you actually stopped to read the ELF specification, you might
have noticed a couple of facts. 1) The different parts of an ELF file
are permitted to be located anywhere (except the ELF header, which
must be at the top of the file), and they can even overlap each other.
2) Some of the fields in the headers aren't actually used.
</p>
<p>
In particular, I'm thinking of that string of zeros at the end of the
16-byte identification field. They are pure padding, to make room for
future expansion of the ELF standard. So the OS shouldn't care at all
what's in there. And we're already loading everything into memory
anyway, and our program is only seven bytes long....
</p>
<p>
Can we put our code inside the ELF header itself?
</p>
<p>
Why not?

Now we've really gone as low as we can go. Our file is exactly as long

there's nothing left to reduce now!
</p>
<p>
Except ...
</p>
<p>
Well, what if we could do the same thing to the program header table
that we just did to the program? Have it overlap with the ELF header,
that is. Is it possible?
</p>
<p>
It is indeed. Take a look at our program. Note that the last eight
bytes in the ELF header bear a certain kind of resemblence to the
first eight bytes in the program header table. A certain kind of
resemblence that might be described as "identical".

<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f bin -o a.out tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>chmod +x a.out</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
       76 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Now we've <em>really</em> gone as low as we can go. There's no way to overlap
the two structures any more than this. The bytes simply don't match
up. This is the end of the line!
</p>
<p>
Unless, that is, we could change the contents of the structures to
make them match even further....
</p>
<p>
How many of these fields is Linux actually looking at, anyway? For
example, does Linux actually check to see if the e_machine field
contains 3 (indicating an Intel 386 target), or is it just assuming
that it does?
</p>
<p>
As a matter of fact, in that case it does. But a surprising number of
other fields are being quietly ignored.
</p>
<p>
So: Here's what is and isn't essential in the ELF header. The first
four bytes have to contain the magic number, or else Linux won't touch
it. The other three bytes in the e_ident field are not checked,
however, which means we have no less than twelve contiguous bytes we
can set to anything at all. e_type has to be set to 2, to indicate an
executable, and e_machine has to be 3, as just noted. e_version is,
like the version number inside e_ident, completely ignored. (Which is
sort of understandable, seeing as currently there's only one version
of the ELF standard.) e_entry naturally has to be valid, since it
points to the start of the program. And clearly, e_phoff needs to
contain the correct offset of the program header table in the file,
and e_phnum needs to contain the right number of entries in said
table. e_flags, however, is documented as being currently unused for
Intel, so it should be free for us to reuse. e_ehsize is supposed to
be used to verify that the ELF header has the expected size, but Linux
pays it no mind. e_phentsize is likewise for validating the size of
the program header table entries. This one was unchecked in older
kernels, but now it needs to be set correctly. Everything else in the
ELF header is about the section header table, which doesn't come into
play with executable files.
</p>
<p>
And now how about the program header table entry? Well, p_type has to
contain 1, to mark it as a loadable segment. p_offset really needs to
have the correct file offset to start loading. Likewise, p_vaddr needs
to contain the proper load address. Note, however, that we're not
required to load at 0x08048000. Almost any address can be used as long
as it's above 0x00000000, below 0x80000000, and page-aligned. The
p_paddr field is documented as being ignored, so that's guaranteed to
be free. p_filesz indicates how many bytes to load out of the file
into memory, and p_memsz indicates how large the memory segment needs
to be, so these numbers ought to be relatively sane. p_flags indicates
what permissions to give the memory segment. It needs to be readable
(4), or it won't be usable at all, and it needs to also be executable
(1), or else we can't execute code in it. Other bits can probably be
set as well, but we need to have those at minimum. Finally, p_align
gives the alignment requirements for the memory segment. This field is
mainly used when relocating segments containing position-independent
code (as for shared libraries), so for an executable file Linux will
ignore whatever garbage we store here.
</p>
<p>
All in all, that's a fair bit of leeway. In particular, a bit of
scrutiny will reveal that most of the necessary fields in the ELF
header are in the first half - the second half is almost completely
free for munging. With this in mind, we can interpose the two
structures quite a bit more than we did previously:

As you can (hopefully) see, the first twenty bytes of the program
header table now overlap the last twenty bytes of the ELF header. The
two dovetail quite nicely, actually. There are only two parts of the
ELF header within the overlapped region that matter. The first is the
e_phnum field, which just happens to coincide with the p_paddr field,
one of the few fields in the program header table which is definitely
ignored. The other is the e_phentsize field, which coincides with the
top half of the p_vaddr field. These are made to match up by selecting
a non-standard load address for our program, with a top half equal to
0x0020.

... but it works! And the program is twelve bytes shorter, exactly as
predicted.
</p>
<p>
This is where I say that we can't do any better than this, but of
course, we already know that we can &mdash; if we could get the program
header table to reside <em>completely</em> within the ELF header. Can this
holy grail be achieved?
</p>
<p>
Well, we can't just move it up another twelve bytes without hitting
hopeless obstacles trying to reconcile several fields in both
structures. The only other possibility would be to have it start
immediately following the first four bytes. This puts the first part
of the program header table comfortably within the e_ident area, but
still leaves problems with the rest of it. After some experimenting,
it looks like it isn't going to quite be possible.
</p>
<p>
However, it turns out that there are still a couple more fields in the
program header table that we can pervert.
</p>
<p>
We noted that p_memsz indicates how much memory to allocate for the
memory segment. Obviously it needs to be at least as big as p_filesz,
but there wouldn't be any harm if it was larger. Just because we ask
for memory doesn't mean we have to use it, after all.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, it turns out that, contrary to all my expectations, the
executable bit can be dropped from the p_flags field. It turns out
that the readable and executable bits are redundant: either one will
imply the other.
</p>
<p>
So, with these facts in mind, we can reorganize the file into this
little monstrosity:

                xor     eax, eax
                inc     eax                     ; e_flags
                int     0x80
                db      0
                dw      0x34                    ; e_ehsize
                dw      0x20                    ; e_phentsize
                dw      1                       ; e_phnum
                dw      0                       ; e_shentsize

  filesize      equ     $ - $$
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The p_flags field has been changed from 5 to 4, as we noted we could
get away with doing. This 4 is also the value of the e_phoff field,
which gives the offset into the file for the program header table,
which is exactly where we've located it. The program (remember that?)
has been moved down to lower part of the ELF header, beginning at the
e_shoff field and ending inside the e_flags field.
</p>
<p>
Note that the load address has been changed to a much lower number &mdash;
about as low as it can be, in fact. This keeps the value in the e_entry
field to a reasonably small number, which is good since it's also the
p_memsz number. (Actually, with virtual memory it hardly matters &mdash; we
could have left it at our original value and it would work just as
well. But there's no harm in being polite.)
</p>
<p>
The change to p_filesz may require an explanation. Because we aren't
setting the write bit in the p_flags field, Linux won't let us define
a p_memsz value greater than p_filesz, since it can't zero-initialize
those extra bytes if they aren't writeable. Since we can't change the
p_flags field without moving the program header table out of
alignment, you might think that the only solution would be to lower
the p_memsz value back down to equal p_filesz (which would make it
impossible to share it with e_entry). However, another solution
exists, namely to increase p_filesz to equal p_memsz. That means
they're both larger than the real file size &mdash; quite a bit larger, in
fact &mdash; but it absolves the loader from having to write to read-only
memory, which is all it cared about.
</p>
<p>
And so ...
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f bin -o a.out tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>chmod +x a.out</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
       52 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
... and so, with both the program header table and the program itself
completely embedded within the ELF header, our executable file is now
exactly as big as the ELF header! No more, no less. And <em>still</em>
running without a single complaint from Linux!
</p>
<p>
Now, finally, we have truly and certainly reached the absolute minimum
possible. There can be no question about it, right? After all, we have
to have a complete ELF header (even if it is badly mangled), or else
Linux wouldn't give us the time of day!
</p>
<p>
Right?
</p>
<p>
Wrong. We have one last dirty trick left.
</p>
<p>
It seems to be the case that if the file isn't quite the size of a
full ELF header, Linux will still play ball, and fill out the missing
bytes with zeros. We have no less than seven zeros at the end of our
file, and if we drop them from the file image:

  filesize      equ     $ - $$
</pre>
</p>
<p>
... we can, incredibly enough, still produce a working executable:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
  $ <b>nasm -f bin -o a.out tiny.asm</b>
  $ <b>chmod +x a.out</b>
  $ <b>./a.out ; echo $?</b>
  42
  $ <b>wc -c a.out</b>
       45 a.out
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<em>Here</em>, at last, we have honestly gone as far as we can go. There is
no getting around the fact that the 45th byte in the file, which
specifies the number of entries in the program header table, needs to
be non-zero, needs to be present, and needs to be in the 45th position
from the start of the ELF header. We are forced to conclude that
there is nothing more that can be done.
</p>
<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p>
This forty-five-byte file is less than one-eighth the size of the
smallest ELF executable we could create using the standard tools, and
is less than one-fiftieth the size of the smallest file we could
create using pure C code. We have stripped everything out of the file
that we could, and put to dual purpose most of what we couldn't.
</p>
<p>
Of course, half of the values in this file violate some part of the
ELF standard, and it's a wonder that Linux will even consent to sneeze
on it, much less give it a process ID. This is not the sort of program
to which one would normally be willing to confess authorship.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, every single byte in this executable file can be
accounted for and justified. How many executables have you created
lately that you can say <em>that</em> about?
