Description of howto use and configure minilib




 API
-----

Please note, the number after "Size:" is an estimation.
Each function added as a function, with all dependent functions,
within a binary that much bytes to the overall size.

It is however not possible to give exact numbers, these depend on how much the compiler
can optimize for each call. What is different each time, depending on the circumstances.

To complicate things more, some functions will be inlined, others will be reused.

And, the choosen linker script will have it's (sometimes surprising) influence.

The linked manpages are from the freeBSD project and there for convenience.
The description of the manpage does not neccessarily match the implementation,
here the description at the reference precedes.
