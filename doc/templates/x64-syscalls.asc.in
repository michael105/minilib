 Syscalls, available at linux 64bit.

 In order to use them, you have to define 'mini_syscalls".
 
 This will define all the syscalls, prefixed with 'sys_'.

 It is however not guaranteed, that the used stuctures and datatypes are implemented,
 some of them might be only predeclared.

 When 'mini_errno' is defined, all syscalls do return on error -1, and set errno.

 When errno is not defined, the syscalls return on error the negative value of errno.
 Not using the global errno spares some bytes and ressources, and eventually
 global variables at all. (Important when using threads)
