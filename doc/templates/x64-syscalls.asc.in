In order to enable the macros of the syscalls, +
please enable the configuration switch 'mini_syscalls'.

Please note, most of the naked syscalls are not tested. +
It might happen, amongst other problems,
that some of the types of the arguments are 
just predeclared, and no definition is given.

When errno is used (via the config switch mini_errno),
the syscalls return -1 on error and set errno.

If errno isn't defined, the negative value of errno is returned 
on error.
