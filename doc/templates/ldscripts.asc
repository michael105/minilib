Linker scripts
--------------


There are different linker scripts embedded into minilibcompiled.h and mlcc.

They are unpacked and piped to gcc, when using mlcc.

Which script is used, depends on the configuration setting of 
'LDSCRIPT', or the argument --ldscript of mlcc.

The sizes of the compiled binaries depend very much on what script is going to be used.
