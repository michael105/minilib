Linker scripts
--------------


There are different linker scripts embedded into minilibcompiled.h and minimake.

They are unpacked and piped to gcc, when using minimake.

Which script is used, depends on the configuration setting of 
'LDSCRIPT', or the argument --ldscript of minimake.

The sizes of the compiled binaries depend very much on what script is going to be used.
