Linker scripts
--------------


There are different linker scripts embedded into minilibcompiled.h and mini-gcc.

They are unpacked and piped to gcc, when using mini-gcc.

Which script is used, depends on the configuration setting of 
'LDSCRIPT', or the argument --ldscript of mini-gcc.

The sizes of the compiled binaries depend very much on what script is going to be used.
