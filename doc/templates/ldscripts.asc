Linker scripts
--------------


There are different linker scripts embedded into minilibcompiled.h and minicc.

They are unpacked and piped to gcc, when using minicc.

Which script is used, depends on the configuration setting of 
'LDSCRIPT', or the argument --ldscript of minicc.

The sizes of the compiled binaries depend very much on what script is going to be used.
