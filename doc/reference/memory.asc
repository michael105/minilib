[[brk]]
brk::

  _int brk( const void* addr )_ + 
 *change data segment size*
-----
set the brk to addr
 return 0 on success.
 conformant brk, when mini_errno is defined return -1 and set errno.
 if errno isn't available,
 returns the negative errno value on error

[[free_brk]]
free_brk::

  _int free_brk()_ + 
-----
free all memory,
 which has been allocated with malloc_brk.
 Returns 0, if memory has been freed;
 1, when there hasn't been any memory allocations with
 malloc_brk before.
 Then brk() gives an error, return the return value of brk

 Here we go.. with the .. well. 
 Fastes and smallest malloc/free combi ever. 
 Not the smartest.
 Since it isn't exactly a memory allocation,
 instead it (mis)uses the minilib buf.
 ;) 1024 Bytes should be enough for everyone.
  Ok. If you really do need more memory - 
  rethink your design, increase mini_mbuf,
  or use a proper malloc implementation.

 Here we use mbuf from top to bottom as stack.
 64 Bytes are left at the bottom as reserve.
 Possibly we'd like to complain
 about the lack of memory, before we exit..

 ATM, the 'free' is really lazy. 
 It free's memory, but a real 'free' is only commited,
 when all memory below a freed area is also freed.
 Since the target of minilib atm are tiny tools, 
 this might be ok.
 ;) but, as I told before - 
 probably you should look out for a proper malloc implementation.
 It depends on your needs.

 I'm not sure yet, 
 whether another implementation of free would be useful at all.
 Overall, I'd really prefer keeping minilib tiny.

 Reusing sparse freed memory areas also leads 
 to a whole bunch of complications.
 cache misses, searching complexity,
 storage overhead, potentially page faults,
 just to name a few.

 I'm not sure whether it's worth it.

 And the existing malloc implementations 
 out there are countless.

 ;) It's sometimes smarter to stay special,
 although in this case this means the opposite.

 The memory layout looks like this:
 mlgl->ibuf and mlgl->mbuf do point to the same address range.
 mlgl->ibuf is provided for alignment and faster access to the int values.

 flag prev free is the first bit in size. (0x8000, eq 1000 0000 0000 0000 binary when free), 
 (mbufsize)

[[malloc_brk]]
malloc_brk::

  _void* malloc_brk(int size)_ + 
 *Defines:* sbrk + 
-----
allocate via setting the brk
 free and realloc can be used normally.
 The intention of malloc_brk is for subsequent calls to realloc.
 The saved data has not to be copied,
 instead realloc just writes the new size and sets 
 the brk accordingly.
 if the break is saved before one or more calls to malloc_brk,
 the allocated memory can also be free'd by setting the brk to the saved value
 with brk(saved_brk)
 free_brk() free's all memory, which has been allocated with malloc_brk
