<p>FCNTL(2) BSD System Calls Manual FCNTL(2)</p>
<p><strong>NAME</strong></p>
<p><strong>fcntl</strong> — file control</p>
<p><strong>LIBRARY</strong></p>
<p>Standard C&nbsp;Library (libc, −lc)</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;</strong></p>
<p><em>int</em></p>
<p><strong>fcntl</strong>(<em>int&nbsp;fd</em>, <em>int&nbsp;cmd</em>, <em>...</em>);</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>fcntl</strong>() system call provides for control over descriptors. The
argument <em>fd</em> is a descriptor to be operated on by <em>cmd</em> as described
below. Depending on the value of <em>cmd</em>, <strong>fcntl</strong>() can take an
additional third argument <em>int arg</em>.</p>
<p>F_DUPFD</p>
<p>Return a new descriptor as follows:</p>
<p><strong>•</strong></p>
<p>Lowest numbered available descriptor greater than or equal to <em>arg</em>.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong></p>
<p>Same object references as the original descriptor.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong></p>
<p>New descriptor shares the same file offset if the object was a file.</p>
<p><strong>•</strong></p>
<p>Same access mode (read, write or read/write).</p>
<p><strong>•</strong></p>
<p>Same file status flags (i.e., both file descriptors share the same file
status flags).</p>
<p><strong>•</strong></p>
<p>The close-on-exec flag FD_CLOEXEC associated with the new file
descriptor is cleared, so the file descriptor is to remain open across
execve(2) system calls.</p>
<p>F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC</p>
<p>Like F_DUPFD, but the FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with the new file
descriptor is set, so the file descriptor is closed when execve(2)
system call executes.</p>
<p>F_DUP2FD</p>
<p>It is functionally equivalent to</p>
<p>dup2(fd, arg)</p>
<p>F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC</p>
<p>Like F_DUP2FD, but the FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with the new file
descriptor is set.</p>
<p>The F_DUP2FD and F_DUP2FD_CLOEXEC constants are not portable, so they
should not be used if portability is needed. Use <strong>dup2</strong>() instead of
F_DUP2FD.</p>
<p>F_GETFD</p>
<p>Get the close-on-exec flag associated with the file descriptor <em>fd</em> as
FD_CLOEXEC. If the returned value ANDed with FD_CLOEXEC is 0, the file
will remain open across <strong>exec</strong>(), otherwise the file will be closed
upon execution of <strong>exec</strong>() (<em>arg</em> is ignored).</p>
<p>F_SETFD</p>
<p>Set the close-on-exec flag associated with <em>fd</em> to <em>arg</em>, where <em>arg</em> is
either 0 or FD_CLOEXEC, as described above.</p>
<p>F_GETFL</p>
<p>Get descriptor status flags, as described below (<em>arg</em> is ignored).</p>
<p>F_SETFL</p>
<p>Set descriptor status flags to <em>arg</em>.</p>
<p>F_GETOWN</p>
<p>Get the process ID or process group currently receiving SIGIO and SIGURG
signals; process groups are returned as negative values (<em>arg</em> is
ignored).</p>
<p>F_SETOWN</p>
<p>Set the process or process group to receive SIGIO and SIGURG signals;
process groups are specified by supplying <em>arg</em> as negative, otherwise
<em>arg</em> is interpreted as a process ID.</p>
<p>F_READAHEAD</p>
<p>Set or clear the read ahead amount for sequential access to the third
argument, <em>arg</em>, which is rounded up to the nearest block size. A zero
value in <em>arg</em> turns off read ahead, a negative value restores the
system default.</p>
<p>F_RDAHEAD</p>
<p>Equivalent to Darwin counterpart which sets read ahead amount of 128KB
when the third argument, <em>arg</em> is non-zero. A zero value in <em>arg</em> turns
off read ahead.</p>
<p>The flags for the F_GETFL and F_SETFL flags are as follows:</p>
<p>O_NONBLOCK</p>
<p>Non-blocking I/O; if no data is available to a read(2) system call, or
if a write(2) operation would block, the read or write call returns -1
with the error EAGAIN.</p>
<p>O_APPEND</p>
<p>Force each write to append at the end of file; corresponds to the
O_APPEND flag of open(2).</p>
<p>O_DIRECT</p>
<p>Minimize or eliminate the cache effects of reading and writing. The
system will attempt to avoid caching the data you read or write. If it
cannot avoid caching the data, it will minimize the impact the data has
on the cache. Use of this flag can drastically reduce performance if not
used with care.</p>
<p>O_ASYNC</p>
<p>Enable the SIGIO signal to be sent to the process group when I/O is
possible, e.g., upon availability of data to be read.</p>
<p>Several commands are available for doing advisory file locking; they all
operate on the following structure:</p>
<p>struct flock {</p>

<div class="line">};</div>
<div class="line">The commands available for advisory record locking are as follows:</div>
</div>
<p>F_GETLK</p>
<p>Get the first lock that blocks the lock description pointed to by the
third argument, <em>arg</em>, taken as a pointer to a <em>struct flock</em> (see
above). The information retrieved overwrites the information passed to
<strong>fcntl</strong>() in the <em>flock</em> structure. If no lock is found that would
prevent this lock from being created, the structure is left unchanged by
this system call except for the lock type which is set to F_UNLCK.</p>
<p>F_SETLK</p>
<p>Set or clear a file segment lock according to the lock description
pointed to by the third argument, <em>arg</em>, taken as a pointer to a <em>struct
flock</em> (see above). F_SETLK is used to establish shared (or read) locks
(F_RDLCK) or exclusive (or write) locks, (F_WRLCK), as well as remove
either type of lock (F_UNLCK). If a shared or exclusive lock cannot be
set, <strong>fcntl</strong>() returns immediately with EAGAIN.</p>
<p>F_SETLKW</p>
<p>This command is the same as F_SETLK except that if a shared or exclusive
lock is blocked by other locks, the process waits until the request can
be satisfied. If a signal that is to be caught is received while
<strong>fcntl</strong>() is waiting for a region, the <strong>fcntl</strong>() will be
interrupted if the signal handler has not specified the SA_RESTART (see
sigaction(2)).</p>
<p>When a shared lock has been set on a segment of a file, other processes
can set shared locks on that segment or a portion of it. A shared lock
prevents any other process from setting an exclusive lock on any portion
of the protected area. A request for a shared lock fails if the file
descriptor was not opened with read access.</p>
<p>An exclusive lock prevents any other process from setting a shared lock
or an exclusive lock on any portion of the protected area. A request for
an exclusive lock fails if the file was not opened with write access.</p>
<p>The value of <em>l_whence</em> is SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END to indicate
that the relative offset, <em>l_start</em> bytes, will be measured from the
start of the file, current position, or end of the file, respectively.
The value of <em>l_len</em> is the number of consecutive bytes to be locked. If
<em>l_len</em> is negative, <em>l_start</em> means end edge of the region. The <em>l_pid</em>
and <em>l_sysid</em> fields are only used with F_GETLK to return the process ID
of the process holding a blocking lock and the system ID of the system
that owns that process. Locks created by the local system will have a
system ID of zero. After a successful F_GETLK request, the value of
<em>l_whence</em> is SEEK_SET.</p>
<p>Locks may start and extend beyond the current end of a file, but may not
start or extend before the beginning of the file. A lock is set to
extend to the largest possible value of the file offset for that file if
<em>l_len</em> is set to zero. If <em>l_whence</em> and <em>l_start</em> point to the
beginning of the file, and <em>l_len</em> is zero, the entire file is locked.
If an application wishes only to do entire file locking, the flock(2)
system call is much more efficient.</p>
<p>There is at most one type of lock set for each byte in the file. Before
a successful return from an F_SETLK or an F_SETLKW request when the
calling process has previously existing locks on bytes in the region
specified by the request, the previous lock type for each byte in the
specified region is replaced by the new lock type. As specified above
under the descriptions of shared locks and exclusive locks, an F_SETLK
or an F_SETLKW request fails or blocks respectively when another process
has existing locks on bytes in the specified region and the type of any
of those locks conflicts with the type specified in the request.</p>
<p>The queuing for F_SETLKW requests on local files is fair; that is, while
the thread is blocked, subsequent requests conflicting with its requests
will not be granted, even if these requests do not conflict with
existing locks.</p>
<p>This interface follows the completely stupid semantics of System V and
IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (‘‘POSIX.1’’) that require that all locks
associated with a file for a given process are removed when <em>any</em> file
descriptor for that file is closed by that process. This semantic means
that applications must be aware of any files that a subroutine library
may access. For example if an application for updating the password file
locks the password file database while making the update, and then calls
getpwnam(3) to retrieve a record, the lock will be lost because
getpwnam(3) opens, reads, and closes the password database. The database
close will release all locks that the process has associated with the
database, even if the library routine never requested a lock on the
database. Another minor semantic problem with this interface is that
locks are not inherited by a child process created using the fork(2)
system call. The flock(2) interface has much more rational last close
semantics and allows locks to be inherited by child processes. The
flock(2) system call is recommended for applications that want to ensure
the integrity of their locks when using library routines or wish to pass
locks to their children.</p>
<p>The <strong>fcntl</strong>(), flock(2), and lockf(3) locks are compatible.
Processes using different locking interfaces can cooperate over the same
file safely. However, only one of such interfaces should be used within
the same process. If a file is locked by a process through flock(2), any
record within the file will be seen as locked from the viewpoint of
another process using <strong>fcntl</strong>() or lockf(3), and vice versa. Note
that <strong>fcntl</strong>(<em>F_GETLK</em>) returns −1 in <em>l_pid</em> if the process holding
a blocking lock previously locked the file descriptor by flock(2).</p>
<p>All locks associated with a file for a given process are removed when
the process terminates.</p>
<p>All locks obtained before a call to execve(2) remain in effect until the
new program releases them. If the new program does not know about the
locks, they will not be released until the program exits.</p>
<p>A potential for deadlock occurs if a process controlling a locked region
is put to sleep by attempting to lock the locked region of another
process. This implementation detects that sleeping until a locked region
is unlocked would cause a deadlock and fails with an EDEADLK error.</p>
<p><strong>RETURN VALUES</strong></p>
<p>Upon successful completion, the value returned depends on <em>cmd</em> as
follows:</p>
<p>F_DUPFD</p>
<p>A new file descriptor.</p>
<p>F_DUP2FD</p>
<p>A file descriptor equal to <em>arg</em>.</p>
<p>F_GETFD</p>
<p>Value of flag (only the low-order bit is defined).</p>
<p>F_GETFL</p>
<p>Value of flags.</p>
<p>F_GETOWN</p>
<p>Value of file descriptor owner.</p>
<p>other</p>
<p>Value other than -1.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and <em>errno</em> is set to indicate the
error.</p>
<p><strong>ERRORS</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>fcntl</strong>() system call will fail if:</p>
<p>[EAGAIN]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_SETLK, the type of lock (<em>l_type</em>) is a shared
lock (F_RDLCK) or exclusive lock (F_WRLCK), and the segment of a file to
be locked is already exclusive-locked by another process; or the type is
an exclusive lock and some portion of the segment of a file to be locked
is already shared-locked or exclusive-locked by another process.</p>
<p>[EBADF]</p>
<p>The <em>fd</em> argument is not a valid open file descriptor.</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_DUP2FD, and <em>arg</em> is not a valid file
descriptor.</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_SETLK or F_SETLKW, the type of lock (<em>l_type</em>)
is a shared lock (F_RDLCK), and <em>fd</em> is not a valid file descriptor open
for reading.</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_SETLK or F_SETLKW, the type of lock (<em>l_type</em>)
is an exclusive lock (F_WRLCK), and <em>fd</em> is not a valid file descriptor
open for writing.</p>
<p>[EDEADLK]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_SETLKW, and a deadlock condition was detected.</p>
<p>[EINTR]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_SETLKW, and the system call was interrupted by a
signal.</p>
<p>[EINVAL]</p>
<p>The <em>cmd</em> argument is F_DUPFD and <em>arg</em> is negative or greater than the
maximum allowable number (see getdtablesize(2)).</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_GETLK, F_SETLK or F_SETLKW and the data to which
<em>arg</em> points is not valid.</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is invalid.</p>
<p>[EMFILE]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_DUPFD and the maximum number of file descriptors
permitted for the process are already in use, or no file descriptors
greater than or equal to <em>arg</em> are available.</p>
<p>[ENOTTY]</p>
<p>The <em>fd</em> argument is not a valid file descriptor for the requested
operation. This may be the case if <em>fd</em> is a device node, or a
descriptor returned by kqueue(2).</p>
<p>[ENOLCK]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_SETLK or F_SETLKW, and satisfying the lock or
unlock request would result in the number of locked regions in the
system exceeding a system-imposed limit.</p>
<p>[EOPNOTSUPP]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_GETLK, F_SETLK or F_SETLKW and <em>fd</em> refers to a
file for which locking is not supported.</p>
<p>[EOVERFLOW]</p>
<p>The argument <em>cmd</em> is F_GETLK, F_SETLK or F_SETLKW and an <em>off_t</em>
calculation overflowed.</p>
<p>[EPERM]</p>
<p>The <em>cmd</em> argument is F_SETOWN and the process ID or process group given
as an argument is in a different session than the caller.</p>
<p>[ESRCH]</p>
<p>The <em>cmd</em> argument is F_SETOWN and the process ID given as argument is
not in use.</p>
<p>In addition, if <em>fd</em> refers to a descriptor open on a terminal device
(as opposed to a descriptor open on a socket), a <em>cmd</em> of F_SETOWN can
fail for the same reasons as in tcsetpgrp(3), and a <em>cmd</em> of F_GETOWN
for the reasons as stated in tcgetpgrp(3).</p>
<p><strong>SEE ALSO</strong></p>
<p>close(2), dup2(2), execve(2), flock(2), getdtablesize(2), open(2),
sigaction(2), lockf(3), tcgetpgrp(3), tcsetpgrp(3)</p>
<p><strong>STANDARDS</strong></p>
<p>The F_DUP2FD constant is non portable. It is provided for compatibility
with AIX and Solaris.</p>
<p>Per , a call with F_SETLKW should fail with [EINTR] after any caught
signal and should continue waiting during thread suspension such as a
