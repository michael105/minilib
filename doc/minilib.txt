               Defines: dirbuf getdents
               (src/dirent/readdir.c: 10)
               read a directory.
              return the next dirent, or 0, if the end is reached.
              return 0 on error and set errno,
              if mini_errno is not defined, return -errno on error

rewinddir      void rewinddir(DIR *dir);
               (src/dirent/rewinddir.c: 2)

scandir        int scandir(const char *path, struct dirent **listing[], int (*fp_select)(const struct dirent *),	int (*cmp)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **));
               Defines: qsort sbrk errno seterrno write 0 brk memcpy dirbuf open getbrk
               (src/dirent/scandir.c: 35)
               list files and dirs in a directory
             
              This implementation uses malloc_brk() for the dynamic allocation
              of the listing, and tries to do as less copies as possible.
              The dynamically allocated space for the result list (**listing[])
              is guaranteed to be at one continuous memory location.
             
              if the select callback is 0, meaning all entries should be returned,
              There are no copies done at all, 
              besides the copying from kernelspace to userspace.
             
              To free the space, allocated for the listing,
              either call free_brk(),
              when no other allocations via malloc_brk took place.
             
              Or save the brk before you call scandir,
              and restore it after the call.
              (e.g.)
              long savebrk=getbrk();
              int ret=scandir(...);
              brk(savebrk);
              Freeing single list entries might give unexpected results.
             
              returns the number of the read entries,
              or the negative errno on error.

seekdir        void seekdir(DIR *dir, long off);

OPTFENCE       static void __attribute__((noipa,cold,naked)) opt_fence(void*p,...);
               (include/syscall.h: 65)
               prevent gcc to optimize away registers and variables
              the macro OPTFENCE(...) can be invoked with any parameter.
              The parameters will get calculated, even if gcc doesn't recognize
              the use of the parameters, e.g. cause they are needed for an inlined asm syscall.
             
              The macro translates to an asm jmp and a function call to the function 
              opt_fence, which is defined with the attribute "noipa" -
              (the compiler "forgets" the function body, so gcc is forced
              to generate all arguments for the function)
              The generated asm jump hops over the call to the function,
              but this gcc doesn't recognize.
             
              This generates some overhead, 
              (a few (never reached) bytes for setting up the function call, and the jmp)
              but I didn't find any other solution,
              which gcc wouldn't cut for optimizations from time to time.
              (volatile, volatile asm, optimize attributes, 
              andsoon have all shown up to be unreliable - sometimes(!)).
             
              Had some fun debugging these bugs, which naturally showed up only sometimes.
              (Many syscalls also work with scrambled arguments..)
              And, I believe it IS a compiler bug. 
              Volatile should be volatile for sure, not only sometimes.
              I mean, why the heck do I write volatile?? 

_itobin        int _itobin(int i, char*buf, int prec, int groups );

              The size of the buffer can be changed by setting mini_dirbufsize
              to it's size in Bytes. (default 2048)
              The buffer is allocated via malloc,
              therefore mini_buf must be set to a value greater than dirbufsize

               hashes, from d.j.Bernstein
              (http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html)
              I've tested djb2_hash, and it gives quite good results.
              But I'm sure, Bernstein did think and test his algorithm sincerely.
              When combining djb2_hash and sdbm_hash, the probability of collisions
              might tend to zero.
              Me I'm going this way. I guess. I might check djb2_hash for collisions within a space of around 8 digits.

               exit, and execute /bin/errno
              this is intended to give a error message for the 
              given errno num.
              Instead of having the error messages compiled 
              into each binary, they can stay within one executable, "errno"
              This spares about 4kB, but needs errno installed to /bin/errno
              It's the drawback of not having a shared library,
              where all executables would share the same errno messages
              in memory.
              On the other hand, a shared library would need to be installed
              as well.

               regex engine
              This is somewhere between a fully fledged expression machine,
              and a simplicistic solution.
              The engine matches from left to right,
              backtracking is done as less as possible.
              Since the matching is nongreedy in general,
              many tries can be spared. Opposed to another route,
              where most patterns are per default greedy, and therfore
              not the first matching next char is seeked for, but the first
              solution while matching the most chars.
              (I do not want to make this a hard statement, and it 
              depends onto each pattern. But it is the way, the solution
              of the pattern is searched for, in most patterns.)
              This shows up in the logic of the patterns, which is more natural to me.
             
              It is a compromise between performance, size
              and capabilities.
              The logic is different of a "regular" regular expression
              machine, but has advantages (and disadvantages).
              I'd say, the main advantage is the easiness of adding callbacks,
              and defining your own matching/logic within these. 
              Performance might be better as well overall,
              but this depends also on the expressions.
             
              A few nonextensive benchmarks show,
              this engine is a bit faster than perl's regular expression machine,
              slower than gnu grep (around factor2), and has the same speed as sed.
              This might however vary with each usecase.
              In favor of codesize I'm not going to optimize ext_match,
              but there would be several possibilities, if you'd need a faster engine.
              (Albite I'd like to emphasise, sed (and ext_match), also perl, are quite fast.
              About 10 times faster than most expression engines.)
             
              matches: 
              
              * for every count of any char
              + for 1 or more chars
              ? for 1 char
              # for space or end of text (0)
              $ match end of text
             
              backslash: escape *,?,%,$,!,+,#,& and backslash itself.
              !: invert the matching of the next character or character class
              ,: separator. e.g. %,1 matches like ?*1. 
                ( without the commata, the '1' would be part of the % match)
               
             
              predefined character classes:
              \d - digit
              \D - nondigit
              \s - space
              \S - nonspace
              \w - word character ( defined as ascii 32-126,160-255 )
              \W - nonword character ( defined as ascii 0-31,127-159 )
             
             
              [xyz]: character classes, here x,y or z 
                the characters are matched literally, also \,*,?,+,..
                it is not possible to match the closing bracket (])
                within a character class
             
              {nX}: counted match
               Match n times X.
               For X, all expressions are allowed.
               If you need to match a number at the first char of 'X',
               separate X by a commata. E.g. {5,0} matches 5 times '0'.
             
              %[1]..%[9]: matches like a '+',
               and calls the callback supplied as 3rd argument (when not null).
               the number past the %, e.g. %1, is optional,
               p_match will be callen with this number
               as first parameter.
               When not supplied, p_matched will be callen with 
               the parameter 'number' set to 0.
             
               The matching is 'nongreedy'.
               It is possible to rewrite the string to match
               from within the p_matched callback.
               This will not have an effect onto the current matching,
               even if text is e.g. deleted by writing 0's.
               The matched positions are called in reverse order.
               (The last matched % in the regex calls p_match first, 
               the first % in the regex from the left will be callen last)
             
              supply 0 for p_matched, when you do not need to extract matches.
              This will treat % in the regex like a *, 
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              if the 5th argument, a pointer to a regex_match struct, 
              is supplied, it will be filled with the first match.
              (counting from left)
             
             
              &[1] .. &[9]
               "match" like a '?' and call p_match_char
               p_match_char has to return either RE_MATCH, RE_NOMATCH, RE_MATCHEND
               or a number of the count of chars, which have been matched.
             
               Therefore it is possible to e.g. rule your own
               character classes, defined at runtime, 
               or do further tricks like changing the matched chars,
               match several chars, andsoon.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH,
               it is possible, the p_match and p_match_char callbacks are callen several times,
               but with different pos or len parameters.
             
               The matching works straight from left to right.
               So, a "*&*" will call the callback & for the first char.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH, the second char will be matched.
               Until either RE_MATCH is returned from the callback,
               or the last char has been matched.
             
               Matching several characters is also posssible from within the callback,
               the position within the text will be incremented by that number,
               you return from the callback.
             
               When returning RE_MATCHEND from the callback, 
               the whole regular expression is aborted, and returns with matched;
               no matter, if there are chars left in the expression.
             
             
               The difference between % and & is the logic.
               % matches nongreedy, and has to check therefore the right side of the star
               for its matching.
               Possibly this has to be repeated, when following chars do not match.
             
               & is matched straight from left to right.
               Whatever number you return, the textpointer will be incremented by that value.
               However, a & isn't expanded on it's own. ( what a % is ).
               e.g. "x%x" will match 'aa' in xaax, x&x will match the whole expression
               only, when you return '2' from the callback.
             
               Performancewise, matching with & is faster,
               since the % has on its right side to be matched
               with recursing calls of ext_match.
             
              When using closures for the callbacks, you will possibly have to
              enable an executable stack for the trampoline code
              of gcc. Here, gcc complains about that. 
              For setting this bit, have a look into the ldscripts in the folder
              with the same name.
             
              supply 0 for p_match_char, when you don't need it.
              This will treat & in the regex like ?, 
              and match a following digit (0..9) in the text,
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              
              -----
              In general, you have to somehow invert the logic of regular expressions
              when using ext_match.
              e.g. when matching the parameter 'runlevel=default' at the kernel's
              commandline, a working regular expression would be
              "runlevel=(\S*)". This could be written here as "*runlevel=%#".
              For matching e.g. numbers, you'd most possibly best of
              with writing your own & callback.
             
              returns: 1 on match, 0 on no match
              ( RE_MATCH / RE_NOMATCH )
             
              if the pointer (argument 5) st_match is nonnull,
              the supplied struct regex_match will be set to the first matching '%' location;
              if there is no match, regex_match.len will be set to 0.
              The struct is defined as: 
              typedef struct _regex_match { char* pos; int len; } regex_match;
             
             
              (memo) When the regex ist defined within C/cpp source code,
              a backslash has to be defined as double backslash.
             
              (note) - be careful when negating a following *, or ?.
               somehow - it is logical, but seems to me I overshoot a bit,
               tragically hit my own foot, and stumbled into a logical paradox.
             
               Negating EVERYTHING translates to true.
               However, since truth is negated as well, there's a problem,
               cause it's now 'false', but 'false' is true. This is very close
               to proving 42 is the answer. What is the escape velocity
               in km/s out of the solar system, btw.
             
               (I'm not kidding here. Just don't do a regex with !* or !?..
               And, please, do not ask me what is going to happen when the impossible
               gets possibilized. I have to point at the according sentences of the BSD license;//  there is NO WARRANTY for CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF PROFIT, etc pp.)
             
               A "!+" will translate into nongreedy matching of any char, however;
               "%!+" will match with % everything but the last char;
               while "%+" matches with % only the first char.
               !+ basically sets the greedyness of the left * or % higher.

              Performance might be better as well overall,
              but this depends on the expressions and usecases as well.
             
              Yet I for myself have to get a grip of the possibilities of this engine.
              However, I have the feeling, the logic is much more natural.
              With regular regexes you always have to think kind of 'backwards',
              e.g., match ".*" -> match "." (any char) x times. 
              gets to a simple "*"
              or, to match all group and user id's of /etc/passwd,
              a regular expression would be: "(\d*):(\d*)"
              This is here: "*(\d*):(\d*)*"
              The content in the brackets looks the same,
              but it's matched quite different.
              The regular expression (the first) matches x times \d, for x>=0.
              In the second expressin, the ext_match expression,
              the first digit is matched, and then nongreedy any chars, until
              the first occurence of ':'. 
              It is another logic. Whether it suits you, you have to decide.
             
              The callbacks have shown up to be a mighty tool, while
              at the same time having a good performance. 
              
             
              A few nonextensive benchmarks show,
              this engine is a bit faster than perl's regular expression machine,
              slower than gnu grep (around factor2), and has the same speed as sed.
              This might vary with each usecase, but the callbacks for extracting matches
              have some advantage, as well as the strict left to right and nongreedy parsing.
             
              In favor of codesize I'm not going to optimize ext_match,
              but there would be several possibilities, if you'd need a faster engine.
              (Albite I'd like to emphasise, sed (and ext_match), also perl, are quite fast.

               If you need to match a number at the first char of 'X',
               separate X by a commata. E.g. {5,0} matches 5 times '0'.

              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              if the 5th argument, a pointer to a regex_match struct, 
              is supplied, it will be filled with the first match.
              (counting from left)
             
             
              &[1] .. &[9]
               "match" like a '?' and call p_match_char
               p_match_char has to return either RE_MATCH, RE_NOMATCH, RE_MATCHEND
               or a number of the count of chars, which have been matched.
             
               Therefore it is possible to e.g. rule your own
               character classes, defined at runtime, 
               or do further tricks like changing the matched chars,
               match several chars, andsoon.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH,
               it is possible, the p_match and p_match_char callbacks are callen several times,
               but with different pos or len parameters.
             
               The matching works straight from left to right.
               So, a "*&*" will call the callback & for the first char.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH, the second char will be tried to match.
               Until either RE_MATCH is returned from the callback,
               or the last char of the text has been tried to match.
             
               Matching several characters is also posssible from within the callback,
               the position within the text will be incremented by that number,
               you return from the callback.
             
               When returning RE_MATCHEND from the callback, 
               the whole regular expression is aborted, and returns with matched;
               no matter, if there are chars left in the expression.
             
             
               The difference between % and & is the logic.
               % matches nongreedy, and has to check therefore the right side of the star
               for its matching.
               Possibly this has to be repeated, when following chars do not match.
             
               & is matched straight from left to right.
               Whatever number you return, the textpointer will be incremented by that value.
               However, a & isn't expanded on it's own. ( what a % is ).
               e.g. "x%x" will match 'aa' in xaax, x&x will match the whole expression
               only, when you return '2' from the callback.
             
               Performancewise, matching with & is faster,
               since the % has on its right side to be matched
               with recursing calls of ext_match.
             
              When using closures for the callbacks, you will possibly have to
              enable an executable stack for the trampoline code
              of gcc. Here, gcc complains about that. 
              For setting this bit, please have a look into the ldscripts in the folder
              with the same name.
             
              supply 0 for p_match_char, when you don't need it.
              This will treat & in the regex like ?, 
              and match a following digit (0..9) in the text,
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              
              -----
              In general, you have to somehow invert the logic of regular expressions
              when using ext_match.
              e.g. when matching the parameter 'runlevel=default' at the kernel's
              commandline, a working regular expression would be
              "runlevel=(\S*)". This could be written here as "*runlevel=%#".
              For matching e.g. numbers, you'd most possibly best of
              with writing your own & callback.
             
              returns: 1 on match, 0 on no match
              ( RE_MATCH / RE_NOMATCH )
             
              if the pointer (argument 5) st_match is nonnull,
              the supplied struct regex_match will be set to the first matching '%' location;
              if there is no match, regex_match.len will be set to 0.
              The struct is defined as: 
              typedef struct _regex_match { char* pos; int len; } regex_match;
             
             
              (memo) When the regex ist defined within C/cpp source code,
              a backslash has to be defined as double backslash.
             
              (note) - be careful when negating a following *, or ?.
               somehow - it is logical, but seems to me I overshoot a bit,
               tragically hit my own foot, and stumbled into a logical paradox.
             
               Negating EVERYTHING translates to true.
               However, since truth is negated as well, there's a problem,
               cause it's now 'false', but 'false' is true. This is very close
               to proving 42 is the answer. What is the escape velocity
               in km/s out of the solar system, btw.
             
               (I'm not kidding here. Just don't do a regex with !* or !?..
               And, please, do not ask me what is going to happen when the impossible
               gets possibilized. I have to point at the according sentences of the BSD license;//  there is NO WARRANTY for CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF PROFIT, etc pp.)
             
               A "!+" will translate into nongreedy matching of any char, however;
               "%!+" will match with % everything but the last char;
               while "%+" matches with % only the first char.
               !+ basically sets the greedyness of the left * or % higher.
             
              (work in progress here) please use ext_match
              return 0 for nomatch, the current textpos ( >0 ) for a match
              With the exception of an empty text, matched by e.g. "*".
              This will return 0, albite the regex formally matches, with 0 chars.
             
              (todo)
              bracket matching () and {} needs debugging. (test/extmatch2 for testing)
              Add a callback for bracket matches, and add a matchlist
              (linked list, allocated with malloc_brk)
              Trouble: e.g. *:(*) doesn't match, albite it should
               .. better. Now: # matches the end, after a bracket. Like it should
                $ doesn't. But should as well.
              change '+' to greedy matching of any char
              for {n,X} let n be * or + as well.
               (this would be closer to regular regulars again.?.)
             
             
              note. About a tokenizer:
              matching quoted string is really easy with the callback structure:
               just match with &. When a quote is matched, look forward to the next quote,
               and return that many chars. Same time, the quoted string is matched.
               That's so easy, it is hard to believe.
               When using closures for that, it is same time easy to collect all tokens.
             
               It is even easier. just a "*("*")*" is enough.
             
               ->There is something needed for partial matching. Possibly spare the last *, and return,
               as soon the pattern is at it's end (and not the text?)
               Already works this way. 
             
               Should start to define the language for the init scripts.
               Or better, start thinking abut that, but follow my other obligations the next time.
             
               Have to think thouroughly about what points would make such a language useful.
               The reason to think about that is clear - performance squeezing, faster startup time.
               And writing the startup scripts in C is. Well. little bit painful.
               However, together with minilib, there is nearly no difference between having a C program compiled
               and run, or working with scripts. To not have the overhead of linking the external libraries in,
               is of quite some advance.
               The only difference, the compiled binaries are "cached".
               have just to sort something sensible out for the systematic.
               Implement an own loader? possibly easy. Since the loading address is fixed.
               This could possibly also be the solution for the yet unclear question of the line between parsing
               arguments and calling the main function of the small core tools, andsoon.

              Instead the overflow (or underflow) touches the next protected page,
              what results in a segfault.
              The size is always a mutliple of the systems pagesize, 4kB here.
              The len of the mapped memory area is rounded up to the next pagesize.
              The mapped area can only be freed by call(s) to munmap,
              neither realloc nor free are allowed.

              protected with PROT_NONE, and len rounded up to the next
              pagebreak. So this is the overhead.

               Negating EVERYTHING translates to true.
               However, since truth is negated as,... well, there's a problem.
             
               (I'm not kidding here. Just don't do a regex with !* or !?.,
               or you might experience the meaning of full featured. 
               Maybe I should say, it's not allowed?)
             
               A "!+" will translate into nongreedy matching of any char, however;
               "%!+" will match with % everything but the last char;
               while "%+" matches with % only the first char.
               !+ basically sets the greedyness of the left * or % higher.

               prevent optimizations.
              cast a var to void*, and calling this,
              leaves the compiler unknown on what he can strip.
              (noipa) means the compiler doesn't know, what the function itself does.
              (the function does nothing, but don't tell that gcc, please..)
              therefore, everything used as parameter to this function,
              will be calculated, defined, and so on before.
              It's used for the globals, 
              shich are pushed within _start onto the stack.
              since _start itself only provides a global pointer,
              and initialitzes some of the globals,
              but doesn't use them again,
              this construction is needed.
              more funnily, the function will never be called.
              It's past the asm inline syscall to exit.
              But again, luckily gcc doesn't know.
              All other options, like having the globals volatile, 
              setting the optimization flag of _start to 0, 
              having a volatile asm call with the globals as param, and so on,
              have been useless. All after all, seems to me, ai has it's restrictions.

              performance of subsequent calls could be improved by replacing all ':' and '\n'
              by 0's when loading the db file.
              it would be possible as well, testing not only single bytes, but
              integers of longs at once. However, in most cases, e.g.
              for big directories with many small files, in most cases 
              all files do have the same owner and group. Since the last result to calls
              of the access functions is cached,
              there wouldn't be an improvement by optimizing the tokenizing functions.
              So I'm leaving this for now, as it is.
              And most possibly it would be better to implement bsd's cached versions 
              of the user db access functions instead.

              Since it isn't exactly a memory allocation,
              instead it (mis)uses the minilib buf.
              Which is allocated by the kernel, and uses

              Albite the list structure might be hard to recognize.
              It is not the right malloc, if you expect
              many de- or reallocations.
              And it obviously is not the right choose, when
              expecting medium to big sized allocations. (> 1 page, here 4kB, as medium sized)
              
              Here we use mbuf from top to bottom as stack.
              64 Bytes are left at the bottom as reserve.
              Possibly we'd like to complain
              about the lack of memory, before we exit.
             
              ATM, the 'free' is really lazy. 
              It free's memory, but a real 'free' is only commited,
              when all memory below a freed area is also freed.
              Since the target of minilib atm are tiny tools, 
              this might be ok.
              ;) but, as I told before - 
              probably you should look out for a proper malloc implementation.
              It depends on your needs.
             
              I'm not sure yet, 
              whether another implementation of free would be useful at all.
              Overall, I'd really prefer keeping minilib tiny.
             
              Reusing sparse freed memory areas also leads 
              to a whole bunch of complications.
              cache misses, searching complexity,
              storage overhead, potentially page faults,
              just to name a few.
             
              I'm not sure whether it's worth it.
             
              And the existing malloc implementations 
              out there are countless.
             
              ;) It's sometimes smarter to stay special,
              albite in this case this means the opposite.
              /misc
             
              The memory layout looks like this:
              mlgl->ibuf and mlgl->mbuf do point to the same address range.
              mlgl->ibuf is provided for alignment and faster access to the int values.
             
              flag prev free is the first bit in size. (0x8000, eq 1000 0000 0000 0000 binary when free), 
              (mbufsize)
              ```
                   size  data  size    mini_buf size
                   8008dataxxxx0004data8000|
                   ----========----====----|
             
              also, when free space is in between two areas
              
              8004data8008  free  0004data8000|
              ----====----________----====----|
             
              ```
              the free space is only freed, 
              when all areas below (left) have been free'd as well.
             
              Memory is allocated from right to left, 
              meaning from top to down.
