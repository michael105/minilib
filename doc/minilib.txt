closedir       int closedir(DIR *dir);

               (src/directories/closedir.c: 6)

               Defines: getdents dirbuf
               (src/directories/readdir.c: 10)
               read a directory.
              return the next dirent, or 0, if the end is reached.
              return 0 on error and set errno,
              if mini_errno is not defined, return -errno on error

rewinddir      void rewinddir(DIR *dir);
               (src/directories/rewinddir.c: 2)

scandir        int scandir(const char *path, struct dirent **listing[], int (*fp_select)(const struct dirent *),	int (*cmp)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **));
               Defines: getbrk write seterrno brk getpid open 0 qsort errno memcpy kill sbrk strlen dirbuf
               (src/directories/scandir.c: 34)
               list files and dirs in a directory
             
              This implementation uses malloc_brk() for the dynamic allocation
              of the listing, and tries to do as less copies as possible.
              The dynamically allocated space for the result list (**listing[])
              is guaranteed to be at one continuous memory location.
             
              if the select callback is 0, meaning all entries should be returned,
              There are no copies done at all, 
              besides the copying from kernelspace to userspace.
             
              To free the space, allocated for the listing,
              either call free_brk(),
              when no other allocations via malloc_brk took place.
             
              Or save the brk before you call scandir,
              and restore it after the call.
              (e.g.)
              long savebrk=getbrk();
              int ret=scandir(...);
              brk(savebrk);
              Freeing single list entries might give unexpected results.
             
              returns the number of the read entries,
              or the negative errno on error.

ALIGN          
               (macros/alignment.h: 9)
               macros for alignment.
              They take a number or pointer, and align upwards to 2,4,8,..256
              There are the macros ALIGN_2 ALIGN_4 ALIGN_8 ...,
              and ALIGN_P, which aligns to the size of a pointer. (8 for amd64)

OPTFENCE       static void __attribute__((noipa,cold,naked)) opt_fence(void*p,...);
               (include/syscall.h: 65)
               prevent gcc to optimize away registers and variables
              the macro OPTFENCE(...) can be invoked with any parameter.
              The parameters will get calculated, even if gcc doesn't recognize
              the use of the parameters, e.g. cause they are needed for an inlined asm syscall.
             
              The macro translates to an asm jmp and a function call to the function 
              opt_fence, which is defined with the attribute "noipa" -
              (the compiler "forgets" the function body, so gcc is forced
              to generate all arguments for the function)
              The generated asm jump hops over the call to the function,
              but this gcc doesn't recognize.
             
              This generates some overhead, 
              (a few (never reached) bytes for setting up the function call, and the jmp)
              but I didn't find any other solution,
              which gcc wouldn't cut for optimizations from time to time.
              (volatile, volatile asm, optimize attributes, 
              andsoon have all shown up to be unreliable - sometimes(!)).
             
              Had some fun debugging these bugs, which naturally showed up only sometimes.
              (Many syscalls also work with scrambled arguments..)
              And, I believe it IS a compiler bug. 
              Volatile should be volatile for sure, not only sometimes.
              I mean, why the heck do I write volatile?? 

OPTIMIZATIONS  
               (include/config.h: 33)

              with a slitghtly bigger memory footprint.

              (http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~oz/hash.html)
              I've tested djb2_hash, and it gives quite good results.
              I'm sure, Bernstein did think and test his algorithm sincerely.
              When combining djb2_hash and sdbm_hash, the probability of collisions
              might tend to zero.
              Me I'm going this way. I guess. I might check djb2_hash for collisions within a space of around 8 digits.
              The hash functions compute the hashes of a c string with a 0 at the end.

              this is intended to give a error message for the 
              given errno num.
              Instead of having the error messages compiled 
              into each binary, they can stay within one executable, "errno"
              This spares about 4kB, but needs errno installed to /bin/errno
              It's the drawback of not having a shared library,
              where all executables would share the same errno messages
              in memory.
              On the other hand, a shared library would need to be installed
              as well.
              The supplied errno can be negative,
              the absolute value is supplied to errno.

               text matching engine
             
              little bit simpler version than match_ext.
              Consciusly named 'text matching', since the inherent logic
              is quite different to a regular expression machine.
             
              The engine matches nongreedy straight from left to right,
              so backtracking is minimized.
              It is a compromise between performance, size
              and capabilities.

              % : matches like a '+', and fills in argument 3,
              the text_match struct, when the pointer is non null.
              The matching is 'nongreedy'.
             
             
              returns: 1 on match, 0 on no match
              ( RE_MATCH / RE_NOMATCH )
             
              if the pointer (argument 3) st_match is nonnull,
              the supplied struct text_match will be set to the first matching '%' location;
              if there is no match, text_match.len will be set to 0.
             
              The struct is defined as: 
              typedef struct _text_match { char* pos; int len; } text_match;
             
              examples: 
              "*word*"  matches "words are true" or "true words are rare"
              "word*"   matches "words are true" and not "true words are rare"
              "word"    matches none of the above two texts (!)
              "*words%" extracts with % " are true" and " are rare"
                        into text_match
              
              "Some\ntext\nwith\nlinebreaks\n\n"
              "*@%#*" matches with % "Some"
              "*@line%#*" matches % = "breaks"
              "*text\n%"  % = "with linebreaks\n\n"
             
             
              (memo) When the regex ist defined within C/cpp source code,
              a backslash has to be defined as double backslash.
             
              (note) - be careful when negating a following *, or ?.
               somehow - it is logical, but seems to me I overshoot a bit,
               and tapped into a logical paradox.
               Negating EVERYTHING translates to true.
               However, since truth is negated as,... well, there's a problem.
             
               (I'm not kidding here. Just don't do a regex with !* or !?.,
               or you might experience the meaning of full featured. 
               Maybe I should say, it's not allowed?)
             
               A "!+" will translate into nongreedy matching of any char, however;
               "%!+" will match with % everything but the last char;
               while "%+" matches with % only the first char.
               !+ basically sets the greedyness of the left * or % higher.

               text matching engine
             
              This is somewhere between a fully fledged expression machine,
              and a simplicistic solution.
              Consciusly named 'text matching', since the inherent logic
              is quite different to a regular expression machine.
             
              The engine matches from left to right,
              backtracking is done as less as possible.
              Since the matching is nongreedy in general,
              many tries can be spared. Opposed to another route,
              where most patterns are per default greedy, and therfore
              not the first matching next char is seeked for, but the first
              solution while matching the most chars.
              (I do not want to make this a hard statement, and it 
              depends onto each pattern. But it is the way, the solution
              of the pattern is searched for, in most patterns.)
              This shows up in the logic of the patterns, which is more natural to me.
             
              It is a compromise between performance, size
              and capabilities.
              The logic is different of a "regular" regular expression
              machine, but has advantages (and disadvantages).
              I'd say, the main advantage is the easiness of adding callbacks,
              and defining your own matching/logic within these. 
              Performance might be better as well overall,
              but this depends also on the expressions.
             
              A few nonextensive benchmarks show,
              this engine is a bit faster than perl's regular expression machine,
              slower than gnu grep (around factor2), and has the same speed as sed.
              This might however vary with each usecase.
              In favor of codesize I'm not going to optimize match_ext,
              but there would be several possibilities, if you'd need a faster engine.
              (Albite I'd like to emphasise, sed (and match_ext), also perl, are quite fast.
              About 10 times faster than most expression engines.)
             
              matches: 
              
              * for every count of any char
              + for 1 or more chars
              ? for 1 char
              # for space or end of text (0)
              $ match end of text
             
              backslash: escape *,?,%,$,!,+,#,& and backslash itself.
              !: invert the matching of the next character or character class
              ,: separator. e.g. %,1 matches like ?*1. 
                ( without the commata, the '1' would be part of the % match)
               
             
              predefined character classes:
              \d - digit
              \D - nondigit
              \s - space
              \S - nonspace
              \w - word character ( defined as ascii 32-126,160-255 )
              \W - nonword character ( defined as ascii 0-31,127-159 )
             
             
              [xyz]: character classes, here x,y or z 
                the characters are matched literally, also \,*,?,+,..
                it is not possible to match the closing bracket (])
                within a character class
             
              {nX}: counted match
               Match n times X.
               For X, all expressions are allowed.
               If you need to match a number at the first char of 'X',
               separate X by a commata. E.g. {5,0} matches 5 times '0'.
             
              %[1]..%[9]: matches like a '+',
               and calls the callback supplied as 3rd argument (when not null).
               the number past the %, e.g. %1, is optional,
               p_match will be callen with this number
               as first parameter.
               When not supplied, p_matched will be callen with 
               the parameter 'number' set to 0.
             
               The matching is 'nongreedy'.
               It is possible to rewrite the string to match
               from within the p_matched callback.
               This will not have an effect onto the current matching,
               even if text is e.g. deleted by writing 0's.
               The matched positions are called in reverse order.
               (The last matched % in the regex calls p_match first, 
               the first % in the regex from the left will be callen last)
             
              supply 0 for p_matched, when you do not need to extract matches.
              This will treat % in the regex like a *, 
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              if the 5th argument, a pointer to a tmatch_ext struct, 
              is supplied, it will be filled with the first match.
              (counting from left)
             
             
              &[1] .. &[9]
               "match" like a '?' and call p_match_char
               p_match_char has to return either RE_MATCH, RE_NOMATCH, RE_MATCHEND
               or a number of the count of chars, which have been matched.
             
               Therefore it is possible to e.g. rule your own
               character classes, defined at runtime, 
               or do further tricks like changing the matched chars,
               match several chars, andsoon.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH,
               it is possible, the p_match and p_match_char callbacks are callen several times,
               but with different pos or len parameters.
             
               The matching works straight from left to right.
               So, a "*&*" will call the callback & for the first char.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH, the second char will be matched.
               Until either RE_MATCH is returned from the callback,
               or the last char has been matched.
             
               Matching several characters is also posssible from within the callback,
               the position within the text will be incremented by that number,
               you return from the callback.
             
               When returning RE_MATCHEND from the callback, 
               the whole regular expression is aborted, and returns with matched;
               no matter, if there are chars left in the expression.
             
             
               The difference between % and & is the logic.
               % matches nongreedy, and has to check therefore the right side of the star
               for its matching.
               Possibly this has to be repeated, when following chars do not match.
             
               & is matched straight from left to right.
               Whatever number you return, the textpointer will be incremented by that value.
               However, a & isn't expanded on it's own. ( what a % is ).
               e.g. "x%x" will match 'aa' in xaax, x&x will match the whole expression
               only, when you return '2' from the callback.
             
               Performancewise, matching with & is faster,
               since the % has on its right side to be matched
               with recursing calls of match_ext.
             
              When using closures for the callbacks, you will possibly have to
              enable an executable stack for the trampoline code
              of gcc. Here, gcc complains about that. 
              For setting this bit, have a look into the ldscripts in the folder
              with the same name.
             
              supply 0 for p_match_char, when you don't need it.
              This will treat & in the regex like ?, 
              and match a following digit (0..9) in the text,
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              
              -----
              In general, you have to somehow invert the logic of regular expressions
              when using match_ext.
              e.g. when matching the parameter 'runlevel=default' at the kernel's
              commandline, a working regular expression would be
              "runlevel=(\S*)". This could be written here as "*runlevel=%#".
              For matching e.g. numbers, you'd most possibly best of
              with writing your own & callback.
             
              returns: 1 on match, 0 on no match
              ( RE_MATCH / RE_NOMATCH )
             
              if the pointer (argument 5) st_match is nonnull,
              the supplied struct tmatch_ext will be set to the first matching '%' location;
              if there is no match, tmatch_ext.len will be set to 0.
              The struct is defined as: 
              typedef struct _tmatch_ext { char* pos; int len; } tmatch_ext;

              WORK IN PROGRESS, please use ext_match
              Atm, please nested brackets are featureful.
              nesting {} within () seems to work.
              Nesting round brackets within {} gives sometimes
              trouble, when wildcards are used within the brackets.
              I'm leaving this at it is for now. 
              Possibly I'm going to hardcode an error message for nested brackets,
              or nested brackets with wildcards.
             
              This is somewhere between a fully fledged expression machine,
              and a simplicistic solution.
              Consciusly named 'text matching', since the inherent logic
              is quite different to a regular expression machine;
              "natural expressions" might fit better for the name.
             
              The engine matches from left to right,
              backtracking is done as less as possible.
              Since the matching is nongreedy in general,
              many tries can be spared. Opposed to another route,
              where most patterns are per default greedy, and therfore
              not the first matching next char is seeked for, but the first
              solution while matching the most chars.
              (I do not want to make this a hard statement, and it 
              depends onto each pattern. But it is the way, the solution
              of the pattern is searched for, in most patterns.)
              This shows up in the logic of the patterns, which is more natural to me.
              Your mileage might vary.
             
             
              It is a compromise between performance, size
              and capabilities.
              The logic is different of a "regular" regular expression
              machine, but has advantages (and disadvantages).
              I'd say, the main advantage is the easiness of adding callbacks,
              and defining your own matching/logic within these. 
              Performance might be better as well overall,
              but this depends on the expressions and usecases as well.
             
              Yet I for myself have to get a grip of the possibilities of this engine.
              However, I have the feeling, the logic is much more natural.
              With regular regexes you always have to think kind of 'backwards',
              e.g., match ".*" -> match "." (any char) x times. 
              gets to a simple "*"
              or, to match all group and user id's of /etc/passwd,
              a regular expression would be: "(\d*):(\d*)"
              This is here: "*(\d*):(\d*)*"
              The content in the brackets looks the same,
              but it's matched quite different.
              The regular expression (the first) matches x times \d, for x>=0.
              In the second expressin, the ext_match expression,
              the first digit is matched, and then nongreedy any chars, until
              the first occurence of ':'. 
              It is another logic. Whether it suits you, you have to decide.
             
              The callbacks have shown up to be a mighty tool, while
              at the same time having a good performance. 
              
             
              A few nonextensive benchmarks show,
              this engine is a bit faster than perl's regular expression machine,
              slower than gnu grep (around factor2), and has the same speed as sed.
              This might vary with each usecase, but the callbacks for extracting matches
              have some advantage, as well as the strict left to right and nongreedy parsing.
             
              In favor of codesize I'm not going to optimize ext_match,
              but there would be several possibilities, if you'd need a faster engine.
              (Albite I'd like to emphasise, sed (and ext_match), also perl, are quite fast.
              About 5 to 10 times faster than most expression engines.)
             
              matches: 
              
              * for every count of any char
              + for 1 or more chars
              ? for 1 char
              # for space, end of text (\0), linebreak, tab ( \t \n \f \r \v )
              @ matches the beginning of the text or endofline (\n) 
              $ match end of text (\0) or linebreak
             
              backslash: escape *,?,%,@,$,!,+,#,& and backslash itself.
              !: invert the matching of the next character or character class
              ,: separator. e.g. %,1 matches like ?*1. 
                ( without the commata, the '1' would be part of the % match)
               
             
              predefined character classes:
              \d - digit
              \D - nondigit
              \s - space
              \S - nonspace
              \w - word character ( defined as ascii 32-126,160-255 )
              \W - nonword character ( defined as ascii 0-31,127-159 )
              \x - hexadecimal digit (0-9,a-f,A-F)
             
             
              [xyz]: character classes, here x,y or z 
                the characters are matched literally, also \,*,?,+,..
                it is not possible to match the closing bracket (])
                within a character class
             
              {nX}: counted match
               Match n times X.
               For X, all expressions are allowed.
               If you need to match a number at the first char of 'X',
               separate X by a commata. E.g. {5,0} matches 5 times '0'.
               n can be a number, * or +. 
               ('*' matches 0 or more, '+' 1 or more times)
             
              (X): match the subexpression X. atm, no nesting of round () and {} brackets allowed
             
              %[1]..%[9]: matches like a '+',
               and calls the callback supplied as 3rd argument (when not null).
               the number past the %, e.g. %1, is optional,
               p_matched_cb will be callen with this number
               as first parameter.
               When not supplied, p_matched_cb will be callen with 
               the parameter 'number' set to 0.
             
               The matching is 'nongreedy'.
               It is possible to rewrite the string to match
               from within the p_matched_cb callback.
               This will not have an effect onto the current matching,
               even if text is e.g. deleted by writing 0's.
             
               The matched positions are called in reverse order.
             
               (The last matched % in the regex calls p_matched_cb first, 
               the first % in the regex from the left will be callen last)
               / The regex is first matched; when the regex has matched,
               the %'s are filled/ the callbacks executed.
               (x) bracketed patterns are matched the same way.
             
               (Not like &, which callbacks are invoked, while matching)
             
              supply 0 for p_matched_cb, when you do not need to extract matches.
              This will treat % in the regex like a *, 
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              if the 5th argument, a pointer to a text_match struct, 
              is supplied, it will be filled with the first match.
              (counting from left)
             
             
              &[1] .. &[9]
               "match" like a '?' and call p_wildcard_cb
               p_wildcard_cb has to return either RE_MATCH, RE_NOMATCH, RE_MATCHEND
               or the number of the count of chars, which have been matched.
             
               Therefore it is possible to e.g. rule your own
               character classes, defined at runtime, 
               or do further tricks like changing the matched chars,
               match several chars, andsoon.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH,
               it is possible, the p_wildcard_cb callback is callen several times,
               but with different pos or len parameters, since p_wildcard_cb is
               invoked while matching.
             
               The matching works straight from left to right.
               So, a "*&*" will call the callback & for the first char.
               When returning RE_NOMATCH, the second char will be tried to match.
               Until either RE_MATCH is returned from the callback,
               or the last char of the text has been tried to match.
             
               Matching several characters is also posssible from within the callback,
               the position within the text will be incremented by that number,
               you return from the callback.
             
               When returning RE_MATCHEND from the callback, 
               the whole expression is aborted, and returns with matched;
               no matter, if there are chars left in the expression.
             
             
               The difference between % and & is the logic.
               % matches nongreedy, and has to check therefore the right side of the star
               for its matching.
               Possibly this has to be repeated, when following chars do not match.
             
               & is matched straight from left to right.
               Whatever number you return, the textpointer will be incremented by that value.
               However, a & isn't expanded on it's own. ( what a % is ).
               e.g. "x%x" will match 'aa' in xaax, x&x will match the whole expression
               only, when you return '2' from the callback.
             
               Performancewise, matching with & is faster,
               since the % has on its right side to be matched
               with recursing calls of ext_match.
             
              When using closures for the callbacks, you will possibly have to
              enable an executable stack for the trampoline code
              of gcc. Here, gcc complains about that. 
              For setting this bit, please have a look into the ldscripts in the folder
              with the same name.
             
              supply 0 for p_wildcard_cb, when you don't need it.
              This will treat & in the regex like ?, 
              and match a following digit (0..9) in the text,
              a following digit (0..9) in the regex is ignored.
              
              -----
              In general, you have to somehow invert the logic of regular expressions
              when using ext_match.
              Regular expressions could be regarded as "polish rpn notation",
              first the char to be matched, then the count.
              This expression machine could be described as "natural expression" machine.
              First you define the number, then the chars or expression to be matched.
              
              Furthermore, *,% and + match as less as possible.
              You have to think about what needs to follow the wildcards.
             
              e.g. when matching the parameter 'runlevel=default' at the kernel's
              commandline, a working regular expression would be
              "runlevel=(\S*)". This could be written here as "*runlevel=%#".
              For matching e.g. numbers, you'd most possibly best of
              with writing your own & callback.
             
              returns: 1 on match, 0 on no match
              ( RE_MATCH / RE_NOMATCH )
             
              if the pointer (argument 5) st_match is nonnull,
              the supplied struct text_match will be set to the first matching '%' location;
              if there is no match, text_match.len will be set to 0.
              The struct is defined as: 
              typedef struct _text_match { char* pos; int len; } text_match;
             
             
              (memo) When the regex ist defined within C/cpp source code,
              a backslash has to be defined as double backslash.
             
              (note) - be careful when negating a following *, or ?.
               somehow - it is logical, but seems to me I overshoot a bit,
               tragically hit my own foot, and stumbled into a logical paradox.
             
               Negating EVERYTHING translates to true.
               However, since truth is negated as well, there's a problem,
               cause it's now 'false', but 'false' is true. This is very close
               to proving 42 is the answer. What is the escape velocity
               in km/s out of the solar system, btw.
             
               (I'm not kidding here. Just don't do a regex with !* or !?..
               And, please, do not ask me what is going to happen when the impossible
               gets possibilized. I have to point at the according sentences of the BSD license;
               there is NO WARRANTY for CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGE, LOSS OF PROFIT, etc pp.)
             
               A "!+" will translate into nongreedy matching of any char, however;
               "%!+" will match with % everything but the last char;
               while "%+" matches with % only the first char.
               !+ basically sets the greedyness of the left * or % higher.
             
              (work in progress here) please use ext_match
              return 0 for nomatch, the current textpos ( >0 ) for a match
              With the exception of an empty text, matched by e.g. "*".
              This will return 0, albite the regex formally matches, with 0 chars.
             
              (todo)
              bracket matching () and {} needs debugging. (test/extmatch2 for testing)
              Add a callback for bracket matches, and add a matchlist
              (linked list, allocated with malloc_brk)
              Trouble: e.g. *:(*) doesn't match, albite it should
               .. better. Now: # matches the end, after a bracket. Like it should
                $ doesn't. But should as well.
              change '+' to greedy matching of any char
              for {n,X} let n be * or + as well.
               (this would be closer to regular regulars again.?.)
             
             
              note. About a tokenizer:
              matching quoted string is really easy with the callback structure:
               just match with &. When a quote is matched, look forward to the next quote,
               and return that many chars. Same time, the quoted string is matched.
               That's so easy, it is hard to believe.
               When using closures for that, it is same time easy to collect all tokens.
             
               It is even easier. just a "*("*")*" is enough.
             
               ->There is something needed for partial matching. Possibly spare the last *, and return,
               as soon the pattern is at it's end (and not the text?)
               Already works this way. 
             
               Should start to define the language for the init scripts.
               Or better, start thinking abut that, but follow my other obligations the next time.
             
               Have to think thouroughly about what points would make such a language useful.
               The reason to think about that is clear - performance squeezing, faster startup time.
               And writing the startup scripts in C is. Well. little bit painful.
               However, together with minilib, there is nearly no difference between having a C program compiled
               and run, or working with scripts. To not have the overhead of linking the external libraries in,
               is of quite some advance.
               The only difference, the compiled binaries are "cached".
               have just to sort something sensible out for the systematic.
               Implement an own loader? possibly easy. Since the loading address is fixed.
               This could possibly also be the solution for the yet unclear question of the line between parsing
               arguments and calling the main function of the small core tools, andsoon.
               
              ..yet I've to fiddle out the possibilities (and quirks) of this machine.
              seems, this expression language did overpower it's creator.
             
              Bugs (features): 
              matching e.g. *matches*@*doesn't match*
              potentiates the *@* to many possibilities.
              One for every linebreak following 'matches'.

               prevent optimizations.
              cast a var to void*, and calling this,
              leaves the compiler unknown on what he can strip.
              The function attribute noipa means,
              the compiler doesn't know, what the function itself does.
              (the function does nothing, but don't tell that gcc, please..)
              therefore, everything used as parameter to this function,
              will be calculated, defined, and so on before.
              It's used for the globals, 
              shich are pushed within _start onto the stack.
              since _start itself only provides a global pointer,
              and initialitzes some of the globals,
              but doesn't use them again,
              this construction is needed.
              more funnily, the function will never be called.
              It's past the asm inline syscall to exit.
              But again, luckily gcc doesn't know.
              All other options, like having the globals volatile, 
              setting the optimization flag of _start to 0, 
              having a volatile asm call with the globals as param, and so on,
              have been useless. All after all, seems to me, ai has it's restrictions.
             
              With less overhead the macro OPTFENCE(...) goes.
              There the call to the "ipa" function is jumped over,
              via asm inline instructions.

token_s        char *token_s( userdb *udb, char **p );

               tokenizer for the passwd/group files.
              used by the group/user pwentry access functions.
              performance of subsequent calls could be improved by replacing all ':' and '\n'
              by 0's when loading the db file.
              it would be possible as well, testing not only single bytes, but
              integers of longs at once. However, in most cases, e.g.
              for big directories with many small files, in most cases 
              all files do have the same owner and group. Since the last result to calls
              of the access functions is cached,
              there wouldn't be an improvement by optimizing the tokenizing functions.
              So I'm leaving this for now, as it is.
              And most possibly it would be better to implement bsd's cached versions 
              of the user db access functions instead.

              Here we go.. with the .. well. 
              Fastes and smallest malloc/free combi ever. 
              Not the smartest.
              Since it isn't exactly a memory allocation,
              instead it (mis)uses the minilib buf.
              Which is allocated by the kernel, and uses
              either the bss section, or is allocated on the stack.
              (option "globals_on_stack")
             
              This is basically a linked list,
              optimized for fast access, allocation of new elements, 
              and small memory overhead.
              Albite the list structure might be hard to recognize.
              It is not the right malloc, if you expect
              many de- or reallocations.
              And it obviously is not the right choose, when
              expecting medium to big sized allocations. (> 1 page, here 4kB, as medium sized)
              
              Here we use mbuf from top to bottom as stack.
              64 Bytes are left at the bottom as reserve.
              Possibly we'd like to complain
              about the lack of memory, before we exit.
             
              ATM, the 'free' is really lazy. 
              It free's memory, but a real 'free' is only commited,
              when all memory below a freed area is also freed.
              Since the target of minilib atm are tiny tools, 
              this might be ok.
              ;) but, as I told before - 
              probably you should look out for a proper malloc implementation.
              It depends on your needs.
             
              I'm not sure yet, 
              whether another implementation of free would be useful at all.
              Overall, I'd really prefer keeping minilib tiny.
             
              Reusing sparse freed memory areas also leads 
              to a whole bunch of complications.
              cache misses, searching complexity,
              storage overhead, potentially page faults,
              just to name a few.
             
              I'm not sure whether it's worth it.
             
              And the existing malloc implementations 
              out there are countless.
             
              ;) It's sometimes smarter to stay special,
              albite in this case this means the opposite.
              /misc
             
              The memory layout looks like this:
              mlgl->ibuf and mlgl->mbuf do point to the same address range.
              mlgl->ibuf is provided for alignment and faster access to the int values.
             
              flag prev free is the first bit in size. (0x8000, eq 1000 0000 0000 0000 binary when free), 
              (mbufsize)
              ```
                   size  data  size    mini_buf size
                   8008dataxxxx0004data8000|
                   ----========----====----|
             
              also, when free space is in between two areas
              
              8004data8008  free  0004data8000|
              ----====----________----====----|
             
              ```
              the free space is only freed, 
              when all areas below (left) have been free'd as well.
             
              Memory is allocated from right to left, 
              meaning from top to down.

              I just hope, noone relies on an exact sleep time.
              which isn't possible without a real time os, anyways.
              When for whatever reason you'd need nanoseconds exact times,
              best shot might be a spinloop, and looking for cpu ticks.
